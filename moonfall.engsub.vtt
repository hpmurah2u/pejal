2
00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.873
T-minus 15 seconds.

3
00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:07.842
Guidance is internal.

4
00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.746
12, 11, 10, 9...

5
00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.247
Ignition sequence starts.

6
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.818
6, 5, 4,

7
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:19.754
3, 2, 1...

8
00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:23.423
Zero. All engines running.

9
00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:27.328
Liftoff.
We have liftoff on Apollo 11.

10
00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:28.631
Fuel and oxygen steady.

11
00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:31.432
Cabin holding. Power is good.

12
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.835
Altitude is four miles now.

13
00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:36.270
Velocity, 2,195 feet
per second.

14
00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:37.538
Good radar data.

15
00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:40.341
Altitude now, 33,500 feet.

16
00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:41.777
How are you looking?
All your systems go.

17
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.444
They're a go.
Hang tight.

18
00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:45.346
You're a go
to continue power descent.

19
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.749
Uh, Houston,

20
00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:48.383
I'm getting
a little fluctuation.

21
00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:49.317
And, Eagle, Houston,

22
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.753
we got data drop-outs.

23
00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:52.353
Three feet down,
two and a half.

24
00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:53.922
Picking up some dust.

25
00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:56.659
Okay. Engine stop.

26
00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.393

35

I'm gonna get you home.

77
00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:08.677
Our viewers might remember

78
00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:10.646
the accident that happened

79
00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:13.015
during a routine satellite
repair mission 18 months ago.

80
00:06:13.048 --> 00:06:14.917
Today, a D.C. court of appeals
handed down

81
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.885
the final judgement
on ex-astronaut

82
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.887
Brian Harper's
wrongful termination suit

83
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.123
against NASA,
his former employer.

84
00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:23.792
We have obtained footage
of an internal NASA debriefing

85
00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:25.728
where Harper claimed
that the accident

86
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.697
was caused by a mysterious
technological space anomaly.

87
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.001
So, this so-called "swarm"
hit the shuttle?

88
00:06:32.034 --> 00:06:34.870
Yes, for the 50th time.

89
00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:36.839
It impacted
in the Mare Crisium.

90
00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:38.640
Commander Fowler,

91
00:06:38.674 --> 00:06:41.110
a passing meteor
or a solar flare

92
00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:43.812
could have caused that kind
of disturbance, correct?

93
00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:45.147
As you know,
I was unconscious, but...

94
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.849
Yes or no?

95
00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:48.618
Can a solar flare

96
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.053
cause the kind of disturbance
you witnessed

97
00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:52.689
in the shuttle's
onboard system?

98
00:06:52.722 --> 00:06:55.759
I guess, yes, technically.
It could have.

99
00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:57.293
Are you kidding me?

100
00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:00.130
I lost my friend up there.

101
00:07:00.163 --> 00:07:01.731
Because of negligence.

102
00:07:01.765 --> 00:07:03.299
Harper was once celebrated

103
00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:05.201
for his heroic landing
of the Endeavour space shuttle

104
00:07:05.235 --> 00:07:06.970
in spite of
a complete meltdown

105
00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:08.772
of all onboard electronics.

106
00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:10.874
Harper's legal options
have been exhausted

107
00:07:10.907 --> 00:07:12.709
and it's become clear
that the accident

108
00:07:12.742 --> 00:07:14.644
was the result of human error.

109
00:07:14.677 --> 00:07:16.079
Today's loss is the final blow

110
00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:18.248
in this very public
fall from grace.

111
00:07:20.183 --> 00:07:22.852
Hey, Sonny.

112
00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:24.888
Do you need
to be watching that again?

113
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.360
You know what?

114
00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:33.595
Grandma is going to be
so excited to see you.

115
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.168
Dad's not coming, is he?

116
00:07:37.201 --> 00:07:39.370
Your dad's got a lot
going on right now.

117
00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:41.939
I know. That's why
we lost the house.

118
00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:47.111
Maybe he'll come visit you
for Thanksgiving.

119
00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:48.646
Would you like that?

120
00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:53.884
I don't wanna move.

121
00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:56.287
I hate New Jersey.

122
00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:39.397
I'm sorry, sir.
My mum always said

123
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:40.699
"it's better to beg
for forgiveness

124
00:08:40.732 --> 00:08:41.733
"than ask permission."

125
00:08:50.742 --> 00:08:53.278
Oh, crap.
Was that red or blue?

126
00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:55.080
Please tell me it was blue.

127
00:08:55.113 --> 00:08:57.249
Observatorio
Nacional de Chile.

128
00:08:57.282 --> 00:08:58.783
- Esteban?
- Si?

129
00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:00.685
- It's Professor Arrowood.
- Ah!

130
00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:03.221
I see you're logging in
to our telescope, Professor.

131
00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:05.724
Oh, yeah. I'm still tracking
our Moon's orbit.

132
00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:07.459
Would you mind
sending last night's scans?

133
00:09:07.492 --> 00:09:08.994
Use the other e-mail
I gave you though,

134
00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:10.395
not the school one.

135
00:09:10.428 --> 00:09:11.429
Like always, sir.

136
00:09:11.464 --> 00:09:13.199
Somebody took the mop again.

137
00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:15.101
Gotta run.

138
00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:16.269
Um, uh...

139
00:09:16.302 --> 00:09:17.803
- Ciao.
- Adios.

140
00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:21.707
Hola senoras.

141
00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:22.808
Hola.

142
00:09:34.287 --> 00:09:36.055
You're seven
and a half minutes late.

143
00:09:36.088 --> 00:09:37.757
I have to write this up.

144
00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:41.460
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

145
00:09:41.494 --> 00:09:42.728
What can I get you?

146
00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:45.464
I'd like a Pastrami Madness...

147
00:09:46.966 --> 00:09:49.368
...and I would also
like to ask you, dear,

148
00:09:49.402 --> 00:09:53.272
what sauces do you serve
with the pastrami?

149
00:09:53.306 --> 00:09:57.443
Oh, yeah. We've got barbecue,
honey mustard, ranch...

150
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.782
What the fuck!

151
00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:04.952
What was the... the last one?

152
00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.186
One Madness coming up.

153
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.921
We have a strict
no phone policy.

154
00:10:07.955 --> 00:10:09.389
Can I take my 10?

155
00:10:11.558 --> 00:10:14.027
Hello. My name
is Dr. KC Houseman,

156
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:15.495
and I've uncovered
what might be

157
00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:17.197
the most important discovery
in human history.

158
00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:18.498
I need you to patch me through

159
00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:20.200
to the director of NASA
immediately.

160
00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:22.903
Honey, I sell T-shirts
and toys.

161
00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:25.806
I can patch you through
to customer service.

162
00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:26.873
Please hold.

163
00:10:46.293 --> 00:10:47.428
Hello?

164
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.382
Black, two sugar.

165
00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:09.984
Oh, you read my mind.
Thank you.

166
00:11:10.018 --> 00:11:11.119
What are you doing up
so early?

167
00:11:11.152 --> 00:11:13.488
I could ask you the same.

168
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:15.189
Is everything okay?

169
00:11:15.223 --> 00:11:16.991
Will be.
So I'm gonna be home by dinner.

170
00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:19.093
If I'm not,
make sure Jimmy does his homework,

171
00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:22.063
- has a bath...
- You worry too much.

172
00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:23.998
I've got everything
under control.

173
00:11:24.032 --> 00:11:26.167
Right. Talk soon.

174
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.456
Okay, don't everybody
speak at once.

175
00:11:49.124 --> 00:11:51.327
The Moon's orbit
has shifted.

176
00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:53.262
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.598
Its orbital radius
is decreasing.

178
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:57.966
Well, that's not possible.

179
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.501
We thought the same,

180
00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:02.137
so we ran the numbers
and triple-checked our data.

181
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:04.039
So, the Moon's been
orbiting around the Earth

182
00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:05.441
for billions of years,

183
00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:07.009
and now you're telling me
it's changed its course?

184
00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:11.213
This isn't kindergarten,
speak.

185
00:12:11.246 --> 00:12:14.016
Right, uh, yes.
So, on its last orbit,

186
00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:17.219
our Lunar Reconnaissance Probe
picked up something strange.

187
00:12:17.252 --> 00:12:18.655
What is that?

188
00:12:18.688 --> 00:12:20.022
We don't know.

189
00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:21.457
We have
photometric measurements

190
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.225
of gaseous spectra
being emitted from inside.

191
00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:27.297
Where is this?

192
00:12:28.298 --> 00:12:29.866
Mare Crisium.

193
00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:33.903
How many times
do I have to tell you?

194
00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:35.572
I need to speak
to Deputy Director Fowler

195
00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:37.374
immediately.

196
00:12:37.407 --> 00:12:39.409
But this is urgent.

197
00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:41.311
I understand how
a restraining order works,

198
00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.046
but if you people at NASA
won't listen to me,

199
00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:44.247
how am I supposed to...

200
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.281
Hello?

201
00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:52.422
What would Elon do?

202
00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:01.531
Oh, Fuzz Aldrin.

203
00:13:01.564 --> 00:13:04.167
How many times have I told you
to use the litter box?

204
00:13:07.103 --> 00:13:08.438
Oh, God.

205
00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:16.681
"Astronaut Day."
This is today.

206
00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:20.951
Fuzz, you're a damn genius!

207
00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:27.626
Extra back scratches later.

208
00:13:41.172 --> 00:13:44.041
Our teacher said you're
a washed up no-show.

209
00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:46.310
She's complaining to someone.

210
00:13:46.343 --> 00:13:49.180
You really don't look
like an astronaut.

211
00:13:49.213 --> 00:13:52.717
Well, are you going to
teach us about space or what?

212
00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:54.985
Brian!

213
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.988
Brian!

214
00:14:00.492 --> 00:14:03.696
Open the goddamn door.
You're three months late!

215
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.198
Shit.

216
00:14:06.231 --> 00:14:07.700
I can hear you in there.

217
00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:13.371
- Oh, shit. Oof!
- Brian!

218
00:14:20.045 --> 00:14:23.448
To put it bluntly,
the Moon is a megastructure.

219
00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:27.385
Do you get it?
Huge and artificial!

220
00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:28.721
Whoever built
this incredible thing

221
00:14:28.754 --> 00:14:31.289
must think
we're a pathetic species.

222
00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:33.525
But don't even get me
started on eclipses.

223
00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:35.193
They're only possible
because the Moon

224
00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:38.463
is exactly 400 times smaller
than the Sun,

225
00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:41.500
and exactly 400 times
closer to the Earth.

226
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:45.370
Anyone know how that happened?

227
00:14:45.403 --> 00:14:48.074
Uh... 'Cause the Moon's
a megastructure?

228
00:14:48.107 --> 00:14:50.109
Yeah, someone's
paying attention!

229
00:14:55.147 --> 00:14:57.483
Let me tell you kids
something.

230
00:14:57.517 --> 00:14:59.820
When Apollo 12 dropped
their empty fuel tank,

231
00:14:59.853 --> 00:15:02.789
the impact made the Moon
ring like a bell.

232
00:15:02.823 --> 00:15:05.358
Bong!

233
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:09.495
It rang for hours.
And do you know why?

234
00:15:11.397 --> 00:15:13.499
Because the damn Moon
is hollow.

235
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:17.704
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

236
00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:23.543
Hello. I'm Brian Harper.

237
00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:26.212
I'm supposed to be
speaking here today.

238
00:15:26.245 --> 00:15:28.314
Oh!

239
00:15:28.347 --> 00:15:30.851
I'm Dr. KC Houseman,
megastructurist.

240
00:15:30.884 --> 00:15:32.184
It's a real honor.

241
00:15:32.218 --> 00:15:33.352
I'm sorry, who are you?

242
00:15:33.386 --> 00:15:35.222
Um...

243
00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:37.524
I've made
a shocking discovery.

244
00:15:37.558 --> 00:15:40.862
I need you to get me in
touch with NASA immediately.

245
00:15:40.895 --> 00:15:43.597
Well, NASA and I aren't really
on speaking terms these days.

246
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:46.199
Well, that will change...

247
00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:48.535
when you tell them that
the Moon is out of orbit.

248
00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:50.772
Really?

249
00:15:53.206 --> 00:15:55.576
Hey, kids, I'm gonna
go get this all sorted out.

250
00:15:55.609 --> 00:15:56.644
Be right back.

251
00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:58.412
Look at the data.

252
00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:00.447
A natural body does not
change its orbit overnight.

253
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.249
Yeah, well, my natural body

254
00:16:02.282 --> 00:16:04.151
is walking away
from you right now.

255
00:16:04.184 --> 00:16:06.353
There must be something wrong
with the Moon's power source.

256
00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:08.856
- Yeah, that must be it.
- I knew you'd believe me.

257
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.659
People usually think
I'm some kind of crackpot.

258
00:16:11.693 --> 00:16:14.127
Hey, fellas, I need this guy
escorted off the premises

259
00:16:14.161 --> 00:16:15.362
for impersonating me

260
00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:16.764
and creeping out
a bunch of school kids.

261
00:16:16.798 --> 00:16:18.498
I was not
impersonating you.

262
00:16:18.532 --> 00:16:20.300
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to come with us.

263
00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:21.803
Sorry, man.
I got enough on my plate without

264
00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:23.639
some crazy guy thinking
the Moon's out of orbit.

265
00:16:23.672 --> 00:16:25.340
- I'm not crazy!
- Okay.

266
00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:26.407
Read this.

267
00:16:27.542 --> 00:16:29.344
All right, I'm on my way.

268
00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:35.751
Oh. Hi.

269
00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:04.947
Is this a butt dial?

270
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.815
Put on channel 16.

271
00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.416
Well, I thought
we weren't speaking anymore.

272
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:10.686
Are you watching?

273
00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:12.354
The two suspects
who have rolled through

274
00:17:12.388 --> 00:17:14.289
at least two red lights...

275
00:17:14.323 --> 00:17:17.894
Okay, looks like some idiot
tried to outrun the cops.

276
00:17:17.927 --> 00:17:21.397
Yeah. That idiot is your son.

277
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.666
Sonny doesn't even have a car.

278
00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:24.199
I'm still fixing up
the Mustang.

279
00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:26.970
Tom gave him one
for his birthday.

280
00:17:27.003 --> 00:17:29.806
The car has stopped.
It's an expensive sports car.

281
00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:31.741
Two young men that appear
to be in their 20s.

282
00:17:31.775 --> 00:17:34.443
Oh, my God.
Are you seeing this?

283
00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:36.378
LAPD have them in custody.

284
00:17:36.412 --> 00:17:38.213
Out for a joy ride

285
00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:39.548
and this day is not going
to end well for them.

286
00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:40.884
There you have it.

287
00:17:40.917 --> 00:17:42.852
Another high-speed
car chase...

288
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.910
Next case,
Sonny Neil Harper.

289
00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:15.853
It says here
you just turned 18.

290
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.487
Unfortunately,
that makes you an adult

291
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.889
in the eyes of the law.

292
00:18:18.923 --> 00:18:21.558
What? Hey, aren't you
gonna say something?

293
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:24.394
Because of the reckless nature
of your actions

294
00:18:24.427 --> 00:18:27.564
and the amount
of illegal substances

295
00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:29.332
present at the time
of your arrest...

296
00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:30.901
No, Your Honor.
Those drugs weren't his.

297
00:18:30.935 --> 00:18:32.636
They were just his buddy's.
They were on their way

298
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.038
- to a concert.
- Quiet in my court.

299
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.438
Well, he just got scared.
That's why he took off.

300
00:18:35.472 --> 00:18:37.007
All right, that's it.
Bailiff.

301
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:38.876
Your Honor, excuse the actions
of my client's father.

302
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.577
We're prepared to pay

303
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.646
whatever the bail is
right now.

304
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.280
Money's no object.

305
00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.349
Well, I guess that makes
the defendant a flight risk.

306
00:18:46.382 --> 00:18:47.585
Your Honor, we do not mean

307
00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:49.286
to offend the court
in any way.

308
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.522
I'm postponing this
bail hearing till next week.

309
00:18:52.623 --> 00:18:53.992
Bailiff, remove Mr. Harper.

310
00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:55.827
Wait. You can't...
Don't listen to him.

311
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:57.394
You can't put him in jail
for a week.

312
00:18:57.428 --> 00:18:58.830
Please, I'm begging you.

313
00:18:58.864 --> 00:19:00.297
Sonny, I'm gonna get you out.

314
00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:04.335
If you're looking
for the deal of your life,

315
00:19:04.368 --> 00:19:06.337
come to Tom Lopez Lexus,

316
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.706
where you're not
just a customer,

317
00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:09.507
we treat you like family.

318
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.943
Do you have any idea
how a courtroom operates?

319
00:19:11.977 --> 00:19:13.444
Your lawyer was doing nothing.

320
00:19:13.477 --> 00:19:15.013
Oh, so you know better
than my lawyer

321
00:19:15.046 --> 00:19:17.048
who's on a $50,000 retainer!

322
00:19:17.082 --> 00:19:19.450
I thought money
was no object, Tom.

323
00:19:19.483 --> 00:19:21.385
Oh, no, no, no.
It is when you don't have any.

324
00:19:21.418 --> 00:19:23.054
Nice move, by the way.
Sonny's now a flight risk.

325
00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:24.455
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

326
00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:25.824
This guy's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

327
00:19:25.857 --> 00:19:28.059
All right, everyone,
just cool it.

328
00:19:28.093 --> 00:19:30.061
- Now, what the hell happened?
- Oh, what happened?

329
00:19:30.095 --> 00:19:31.529
When Brian had to open
his big mouth,

330
00:19:31.562 --> 00:19:32.596
he had a little speech.

331
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:33.865
Oh, my God. Go to hell, Tom.

332
00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:34.934
Yeah, you know what?

333
00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:36.434
And you go to outer space,

334
00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:37.837
- far away from us.
- Guys!

335
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.705
We're all just trying
to help Sonny right here.

336
00:19:39.739 --> 00:19:41.606
Oh, wait, Brian's trying
to help Sonny? Since when?

337
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:43.475
Brenda, honestly, what do you
see in this schmuck?

338
00:19:43.508 --> 00:19:45.745
Oh, you're a big man,
aren't you?

339
00:19:45.778 --> 00:19:47.814
How did this happen?
Why wasn't he at USC?

340
00:19:47.847 --> 00:19:49.749
He moved out when you
got him that new apartment.

341
00:19:49.782 --> 00:19:51.050
So ask him.

342
00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:52.785
He barely returns
my calls anymore.

343
00:19:52.819 --> 00:19:53.986
Welcome to the club.

344
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.037
Oh, KC, is that you?

345
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.873
Hey, Mum.
Rosmarinus officinalis.

346
00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:16.108
A few studies have found
that smelling rosemary

347
00:20:16.142 --> 00:20:18.110
can improve
your short-term memory.

348
00:20:18.144 --> 00:20:21.113
Oh, that's lovely, dear.
Thank you.

349
00:20:21.147 --> 00:20:22.347
Thank you.

350
00:20:23.817 --> 00:20:26.352
Oh, no, no, no, Mum.
Let me do that.

351
00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:32.092
There we go.
So, how are you feeling?

352
00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:33.392
Great.

353
00:20:33.426 --> 00:20:34.962
But enough about me.

354
00:20:34.995 --> 00:20:36.529
Everybody here knows

355
00:20:36.562 --> 00:20:39.933
that my son is a genius
working at NASA.

356
00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:41.668
What?

357
00:20:43.103 --> 00:20:44.570
I'm a nobody, Mum.

358
00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:46.572
Well, you're somebody to me.

359
00:20:46.606 --> 00:20:48.141
I actually did make
a discovery.

360
00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:49.442
But it doesn't matter.

361
00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:53.146
No one will listen to me.

362
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.413
Then make them.

363
00:20:58.685 --> 00:20:59.820
Make them listen?

364
00:21:03.023 --> 00:21:04.825
Oh, hello.

365
00:21:04.858 --> 00:21:06.727
Are you new here?

366
00:21:07.828 --> 00:21:08.996
No, Mum.

367
00:21:09.997 --> 00:21:12.133
It's me. It's KC.

368
00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:13.533
Your son.

369
00:21:15.203 --> 00:21:18.106
Can someone tell me
what the hell I'm looking at?

370
00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:20.540
The Moon has entered
an elliptical orbit.

371
00:21:20.574 --> 00:21:21.943
Meaning?

372
00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:23.778
It'll circle
around us three times

373
00:21:23.811 --> 00:21:25.479
before it reaches
the Roche Limit

374
00:21:25.512 --> 00:21:27.614
at 17,000 kilometers.

375
00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:30.885
At that point, city-sized
pieces of Moon debris

376
00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:32.921
will rain down on us.

377
00:21:32.954 --> 00:21:34.488
So we have three months?

378
00:21:34.521 --> 00:21:35.757
Not exactly.

379
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.491
As the Moon
moves closer to us,

380
00:21:37.524 --> 00:21:39.060
our months
will begin to shorten.

381
00:21:39.093 --> 00:21:43.131
We've estimated a timeline
of roughly three weeks.

382
00:21:43.164 --> 00:21:44.933
Maybe less than that.

383
00:21:44.966 --> 00:21:47.035
We have some new high-res
scans that just came in.

384
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.905
Jesus Christ.

385
00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:52.941
Is that a hole
in the crater floor?

386
00:21:52.974 --> 00:21:54.943
So what are our options here?

387
00:21:54.976 --> 00:21:56.610
We have to go back
to the Moon.

388
00:21:56.644 --> 00:21:58.112
We have to see
what's going on up there.

389
00:21:58.146 --> 00:21:59.648
How do we carry crew?

390
00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:01.183
I've already talked
to my contacts in Europe.

391
00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:03.919
We can potentially
get a STC-62

392
00:22:03.953 --> 00:22:05.054
en route by tomorrow.

393
00:22:05.087 --> 00:22:06.188
Potentially?

394
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:07.856
Great.

395
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.894
I'll just brief the president
on a maybe.

396
00:22:11.927 --> 00:22:14.029
In the meantime, everyone
keep your mouths shut.

397
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.497
Um...

398
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.202
That might be a problem.

399
00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:24.139
It's, uh, trending on Twitter
as of two minutes ago.

400
00:22:24.173 --> 00:22:25.774
It's your ex-husband.

401
00:22:25.808 --> 00:22:27.676
Thank you.

402
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.279
Hey, Doug, I'm a little busy
right now. What is it?

403
00:22:30.312 --> 00:22:31.880
Is it true?

404
00:22:31.914 --> 00:22:33.182
Tell me there's been
some kind of mistake.

405
00:22:33.215 --> 00:22:34.615
I wish I could,

406
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.819
but the math
actually checks out.

407
00:22:36.852 --> 00:22:38.253
So, it's happening.

408
00:22:38.287 --> 00:22:39.955
How's Jimmy?

409
00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:42.257
Well, you'd know if you
saw him once in a while.

410
00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:45.694
Please don't start.
I call him all the time.

411
00:22:46.796 --> 00:22:48.497
Sorry, I gotta run.

412
00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:50.599
Oh...

413
00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:52.702
- Your Honor.
- Jesus Christ!

414
00:22:52.736 --> 00:22:54.070
I guess hanging up
wasn't clear enough.

415
00:22:54.104 --> 00:22:55.571
I just need two minutes
of your time.

416
00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:57.741
You have
till I reach the door.

417
00:22:57.774 --> 00:22:59.976
I got a classic bike
and my son's vintage Mustang

418
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.277
that I can use as collateral

419
00:23:01.311 --> 00:23:02.912
till I get money,
whatever you need.

420
00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:05.682
Are you trying to bribe me?
In a courthouse?

421
00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:07.017
I just wanna get my son back.

422
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.184
The courts are closed.

423
00:23:08.218 --> 00:23:09.719
Will they reopen Monday?

424
00:23:09.753 --> 00:23:11.087
Not likely.

425
00:23:11.121 --> 00:23:12.655
What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:23:12.689 --> 00:23:14.057
Look, I'm just trying
to get the heck outta here

427
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.925
before the traffic
becomes a nightmare.

428
00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:17.694
- I suggest you do the same.
- Breaking news.

429
00:23:17.727 --> 00:23:19.829
We go now live
to the NASA press briefing

430
00:23:19.863 --> 00:23:21.931
to discuss the Moon
being out of orbit.

431
00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:23.733
Astronomers
have noticed bright lights

432
00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:25.567
on the lunar surface lately.

433
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:27.270
Do you know the identity
of the anonymous source?

434
00:23:27.303 --> 00:23:29.139
Everyone, please.

435
00:23:29.172 --> 00:23:31.607
We're confident that
the lunar recon mission

436
00:23:31.641 --> 00:23:32.809
will provide
the necessary data

437
00:23:32.842 --> 00:23:34.610
to address the problem.

438
00:23:34.645 --> 00:23:37.014
There's no need to panic.
That's all for now.

439
00:23:38.749 --> 00:23:40.284
You just lied
to the whole country.

440
00:23:40.317 --> 00:23:42.353
Get in line,
you work for me.

441
00:23:42.386 --> 00:23:44.055
I work for
the American people,

442
00:23:44.088 --> 00:23:45.656
and you're keeping them
in the dark.

443
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.293
Yeah.

444
00:23:49.326 --> 00:23:50.895
NASA is
completely downplaying this.

445
00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:51.796
Imagine the tides
on the coast...

446
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.665
...growing hundreds
of times larger,

447
00:23:54.698 --> 00:23:56.133
moving hundreds
of miles inland,

448
00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:57.968
then you'll get an idea
of what we're in for.

449
00:23:58.002 --> 00:23:59.370
Some of
your harshest critics claim

450
00:23:59.403 --> 00:24:01.105
- that you're exaggerating...
- Hey.

451
00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:02.106
All flights to the West Coast
have been cancelled.

452
00:24:02.139 --> 00:24:03.107
And I'm stuck in traffic.

453
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.375
Oh, I'm so sorry.

454
00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:06.210
Moving to higher ground

455
00:24:06.243 --> 00:24:07.278
it's the only possible chance
of surviving this.

456
00:24:07.311 --> 00:24:09.346
Honey. We should go to Aspen.

457
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.614
What about Sonny?
We can't just leave him there.

458
00:24:11.649 --> 00:24:13.084
No, no, no.
We're not gonna leave him.

459
00:24:13.117 --> 00:24:14.151
The lawyer's
gonna get him out

460
00:24:14.185 --> 00:24:15.786
the moment the judge
sets bail.

461
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.121
And I'll find a way
to get him to Colorado.

462
00:24:17.154 --> 00:24:18.355
We're going to Colorado?

463
00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:19.824
No. No, Tom.

464
00:24:19.857 --> 00:24:21.358
Earth's stronger gravity

465
00:24:21.392 --> 00:24:23.228
will completely break
the Moon apart

466
00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:25.097
and send thousands

467
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.898
of mile-sized chunks
raining down upon the planet.

468
00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:27.732
Okay, okay, okay. Hey, Google.
Turn off the TV.

469
00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:28.867
Girls, go pack.

470
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.268
Turning the TV off.

471
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.703
Girls, go pack
your snow boots.

472
00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:32.771
Come on. Hurry up.

473
00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:37.776
We have to start thinking
about the girls.

474
00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:38.944
And trust me,

475
00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.847
we are not gonna
forget about Sonny.

476
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.149
T-minus five seconds.

477
00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:46.885
Four, three,

478
00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:49.354
two, one.

479
00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:50.422
Ignition.

480
00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.290
This is it.

481
00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.892
The entire world is holding
its collective breath

482
00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.360
as the joint missions
between NASA

483
00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:57.028
and the European
Space Agencies

484
00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:59.097
take to the skies today.

485
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:00.365
Nations remain hopeful

486
00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:02.234
of NASA's lunar mission

487
00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:04.436
as frantic shoppers continue
to stockpile supplies

488
00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:06.371
as mounting Moon terror fuels

489
00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:09.107
the mass migration
out of metropolitan areas.

490
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:11.244
Civilization
has already taken

491
00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:12.979
a serious nosedive.

492
00:25:13.012 --> 00:25:15.181
Looting has become
a favorite pastime

493
00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:16.916
in the United Kingdom.

494
00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:19.285
Fear and
panic have overtaken our city.

495
00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:23.089
The National Guard struggles
to restore some kind of order.

496
00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:26.292
Stay awake,
my brothers and sisters.

497
00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:30.329
As the stars fall from Heaven,
stay awake!

498
00:25:30.363 --> 00:25:32.131
These armed religious fanatics

499
00:25:32.165 --> 00:25:34.133
have racked up
thousands of followers

500
00:25:34.167 --> 00:25:35.902
all over the country.

501
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.472
In other news,
prominent scientists

502
00:25:39.505 --> 00:25:41.307
are now exploring
the possibility

503
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.909
that perhaps
the Moon could be

504
00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:44.877
some sort of
orbital megastructure.

505
00:25:44.911 --> 00:25:48.181
A term first popularized
by fringe astronomers,

506
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.815
megastructures describe

507
00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:51.384
artificial
planet-sized objects

508
00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:53.819
said to be powered
by captured stars.

509
00:25:53.853 --> 00:25:55.721
This once radical possibility

510
00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:58.124
is now gaining traction
among a scientific community

511
00:25:58.157 --> 00:26:00.227
desperate for answers.

512
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.468
Come out! Hands up!

513
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:12.206
Easy, easy.

514
00:26:12.239 --> 00:26:14.508
You're that astronaut guy
from the other day.

515
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:17.110
I accidentally threw away
some very important papers.

516
00:26:17.144 --> 00:26:19.913
Lucky for you, sanitation
hasn't come by all week.

517
00:26:19.947 --> 00:26:22.382
Yeah, it's, uh, lucky for me.

518
00:26:26.286 --> 00:26:27.988
"Orbital distance"?

519
00:26:29.189 --> 00:26:31.091
Are you looking for this?

520
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:36.763
My fellow
megastructurists,

521
00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:38.165
if you're watching this,
then you know by now

522
00:26:38.198 --> 00:26:39.766
a huge problem
is heading our way,

523
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.201
and we're the only ones
who can solve it.

524
00:26:41.235 --> 00:26:42.302
An emergency meeting
is being called,

525
00:26:42.336 --> 00:26:43.770
our usual place immediately.

526
00:26:43.804 --> 00:26:46.173
L.A. Palm Hotel. Today. 1800.

527
00:26:46.206 --> 00:26:47.809
Free bagels.

528
00:26:55.984 --> 00:26:58.019
Lunar orbit insertion
complete.

529
00:26:58.052 --> 00:27:00.088
Houston, we're approaching
the Mare Crisium.

530
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:02.557
Initiating capsule rotation.

531
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.125
Affirmative.

532
00:27:04.158 --> 00:27:07.095
15 degrees. 30.

533
00:27:08.263 --> 00:27:12.333
45. 70. 90.

534
00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:14.035
STC-62 in position.

535
00:27:19.274 --> 00:27:20.508
Houston, you seeing this?

536
00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:23.978
Copy, we see it.

537
00:27:24.012 --> 00:27:25.380
Prepare to deploy the probe.

538
00:27:25.413 --> 00:27:28.316
Affirmative.
Releasing probe.

539
00:27:30.285 --> 00:27:32.086
Stand by for stage two.

540
00:27:33.187 --> 00:27:34.456
Dropping steadily.

541
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.175
I posted
on every platform.

542
00:27:53.208 --> 00:27:55.611
Why don't those idiots at NASA
see the real problem?

543
00:27:55.645 --> 00:27:57.246
Because they obviously
haven't read

544
00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.181
famed cosmologist
Carl Sagan's work,

545
00:27:59.214 --> 00:28:01.050
where he clearly states

546
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:02.985
that a natural satellite
cannot be a hollow object.

547
00:28:03.018 --> 00:28:06.322
I... I've been saying that
for years, Dr. Houseman.

548
00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:08.290
That doesn't help us now,
does it, Ziggy?

549
00:28:08.324 --> 00:28:10.192
This room is full
of the smartest

550
00:28:10.225 --> 00:28:11.894
and most visionary people
in the world.

551
00:28:13.663 --> 00:28:15.497
We all know the Moon's
a constructed object. Okay?

552
00:28:15.531 --> 00:28:17.066
There has to be a way
to fix it.

553
00:28:17.099 --> 00:28:20.135
Come on, people,
think outside the box.

554
00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:21.870
Oswald did it.

555
00:28:21.904 --> 00:28:23.206
Oh, damn it, Gary. Not now.

556
00:28:27.177 --> 00:28:28.178
Mr. Harper.

557
00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:30.980
What are you doing here?

558
00:28:31.014 --> 00:28:33.249
Probably making
a huge mistake.

559
00:28:33.283 --> 00:28:34.551
Can we talk?

560
00:28:37.087 --> 00:28:38.154
How did you know I was here?

561
00:28:39.422 --> 00:28:40.423
Your website.

562
00:28:41.424 --> 00:28:43.059
You read my blog?

563
00:28:43.093 --> 00:28:45.161
You knew all this was
happening before anyone.

564
00:28:45.195 --> 00:28:47.931
Before NASA. How?

565
00:28:47.964 --> 00:28:49.265
Why bother?

566
00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:51.067
You're just gonna say
I'm crazy again.

567
00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:53.002
Try me.

568
00:28:53.036 --> 00:28:55.605
Well, for years I've been
studying distant planets,

569
00:28:55.639 --> 00:28:57.941
searching for one of
these orbiting megastructures.

570
00:28:57.974 --> 00:28:59.609
But I never could
have imagined

571
00:28:59.643 --> 00:29:01.077
there'd be one right here,

572
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:03.079
in our own backyard.

573
00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.448
Ever heard of a Dyson sphere?

574
00:29:06.449 --> 00:29:07.951
Yeah.

575
00:29:07.984 --> 00:29:09.452
Every megastructure
has a rigid shell

576
00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:11.155
built around a power core.

577
00:29:11.188 --> 00:29:13.224
Most likely
a captured white dwarf

578
00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:14.992
that's being harnessed
for energy.

579
00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:18.162
Something obviously happened
to the one inside our Moon

580
00:29:18.195 --> 00:29:20.531
and that's why
it's veering off course.

581
00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:24.101
Yeah, still crazy.

582
00:29:27.004 --> 00:29:28.239
Why did you come here

583
00:29:28.272 --> 00:29:29.273
if you're not going
to believe me?

584
00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:30.408
'Cause I know what it's like

585
00:29:30.441 --> 00:29:31.643
to try to tell
people something

586
00:29:31.676 --> 00:29:33.277
and have no one listen.

587
00:29:35.012 --> 00:29:37.982
Probe depth
has reached 24.5 kilometers.

588
00:29:38.683 --> 00:29:39.917
25 kilometers.

589
00:29:43.087 --> 00:29:45.122
Holding steady
at 25.6 kilometers.

590
00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:49.728
Still holding.

591
00:29:49.761 --> 00:29:52.396
- It stopped?
- It's coming back.

592
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.365
24 kilometers.

593
00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:56.267
20.

594
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.601
15.

595
00:29:57.635 --> 00:30:00.138
We got another problem.

596
00:30:00.172 --> 00:30:01.641
The Moon's orbit
is shifting again.

597
00:30:01.674 --> 00:30:03.542
What?

598
00:30:03.575 --> 00:30:05.310
It's correcting itself.

599
00:30:10.582 --> 00:30:12.050
Uh, Houston,

600
00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:13.719
we're experiencing
some kind of malfunction.

601
00:30:13.753 --> 00:30:15.187
Houston, do you copy?

602
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.756
Houston, do you copy?

603
00:30:23.495 --> 00:30:24.996
What the hell is that?

604
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.031
I don't know.

605
00:30:30.635 --> 00:30:32.571
Hull breach. Helmets.

606
00:31:28.461 --> 00:31:29.663
In breaking news,

607
00:31:29.696 --> 00:31:31.397
NASA has just corrected

608
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.065
their initial projection...

609
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:35.168
...of the Moon's path
over Earth.

610
00:31:40.742 --> 00:31:42.509
The governor
has just ordered

611
00:31:42.543 --> 00:31:45.713
the mass evacuation
of the entire West Coast,

612
00:31:45.747 --> 00:31:47.281
recommending that people

613
00:31:47.314 --> 00:31:49.349
urgently head
to higher ground.

614
00:31:49.383 --> 00:31:51.719
As the Moon
keeps closing in on Earth

615
00:31:51.753 --> 00:31:53.655
in a chaotic,
and as one scientist put it...

616
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:10.270
Guys!

617
00:32:10.304 --> 00:32:12.272
The... The...
The tide, it's coming.

618
00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:13.574
Come on.
We gotta get outta here.

619
00:32:13.607 --> 00:32:14.608
Wait!

620
00:32:32.193 --> 00:32:33.796
Everybody, upstairs. Go!
Everybody, get up!

621
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:35.196
Come on! Go, go!

622
00:32:38.867 --> 00:32:40.401
KC, what are you doing?

623
00:32:40.435 --> 00:32:42.136
KC!

624
00:32:48.376 --> 00:32:49.645
KC, hang on!

625
00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:55.516
I can't swim!

626
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.551
Dr. Houseman!

627
00:32:57.251 --> 00:32:58.453
Hang on!

628
00:33:06.327 --> 00:33:07.796
He's right there.
He's right there.

629
00:33:08.664 --> 00:33:09.865
Hang on!

630
00:33:13.435 --> 00:33:15.270
Come on!

631
00:33:16.806 --> 00:33:17.807
Come on.

632
00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:23.780
Come on.

633
00:33:31.855 --> 00:33:35.759
It's some kind of self-aware,
self-replicating singularity.

634
00:33:35.792 --> 00:33:37.393
Like a machine?

635
00:33:37.426 --> 00:33:39.628
Machines don't have
intelligence. This does.

636
00:33:39.663 --> 00:33:42.197
It's everything
we feared about A.I.

637
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:43.399
And it knew we were coming.

638
00:33:43.432 --> 00:33:44.834
So it was probably drawn out

639
00:33:44.868 --> 00:33:47.369
by the electronic signature
of the capsule.

640
00:33:47.403 --> 00:33:48.705
Everything
we thought we knew

641
00:33:48.738 --> 00:33:50.372
about the nature
of the universe

642
00:33:50.406 --> 00:33:53.208
has just
gone out the window.

643
00:33:56.012 --> 00:33:58.314
We're not prepared for this.

644
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:04.689
Deb, don't argue, just pack
your stuff. We're leaving.

645
00:34:06.623 --> 00:34:07.825
So you're just gonna quit?

646
00:34:07.858 --> 00:34:09.359
What do you want me to do?

647
00:34:09.392 --> 00:34:10.761
I want you to help us
figure out what

648
00:34:10.795 --> 00:34:12.295
the hell this thing is,
so we can beat it.

649
00:34:12.328 --> 00:34:13.596
We're not equipped for that.

650
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.766
You've seen
what we're up against.

651
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.935
You've been gunning for my job
for a while, Fowler.

652
00:34:17.968 --> 00:34:20.303
Congrats, it's yours.

653
00:34:20.336 --> 00:34:21.604
What are you not telling me?

654
00:34:21.638 --> 00:34:23.339
You've got Q clearance.

655
00:34:23.373 --> 00:34:25.442
The hole is
in the Mare Crisium.

656
00:34:25.475 --> 00:34:28.012
That's what the Harper
hearings were all about.

657
00:34:28.045 --> 00:34:31.481
If you're serious about going
down the NASA rabbit hole,

658
00:34:31.514 --> 00:34:33.718
you should pay a visit
to Holdenfield.

659
00:34:34.885 --> 00:34:35.886
Here's your clearance.

660
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:15.026
How did you
get down here?

661
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.828
Hutchings
gave me this.

662
00:35:16.862 --> 00:35:19.731
I'll need all records
of STX-136A.

663
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:31.743
You waiting for something?

664
00:35:44.857 --> 00:35:46.025
What the hell is that?

665
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.631
I feel it.

666
00:35:57.904 --> 00:35:59.005
What are you doing?

667
00:36:01.473 --> 00:36:02.875
Holdenfield?

668
00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:07.046
You're not supposed
to have that, 136 Alpha.

669
00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.449
That's classified. Top secret.

670
00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:13.585
Why is NASA
lying about all this?

671
00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:16.923
July 20th, 1969.

672
00:36:16.956 --> 00:36:18.958
"One small step for man,

673
00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:21.727
"one giant leap for..."
yada, yada, yada.

674
00:36:21.761 --> 00:36:23.964
In school,
you were taught that Apollo 11

675
00:36:23.997 --> 00:36:26.532
lost contact
with Mission Control

676
00:36:26.566 --> 00:36:29.635
for two minutes. Not true.

677
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.073
Mission Control
cut their feed to the world

678
00:36:33.106 --> 00:36:35.976
because they found something
on that day.

679
00:36:36.009 --> 00:36:38.846
Strange pulsating lights

680
00:36:38.879 --> 00:36:42.515
emanating from beneath
the Moon's crust.

681
00:36:42.548 --> 00:36:47.154
It was me who was assigned
to keep it under wraps.

682
00:36:47.187 --> 00:36:50.657
The Apollo crew played ball.
Everybody after.

683
00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:52.826
Just Brian Harper wouldn't.

684
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.095
They called him crazy.

685
00:36:55.128 --> 00:36:56.596
Threw him out with the trash.

686
00:36:56.629 --> 00:36:58.932
You're telling me
that the Moon

687
00:36:58.966 --> 00:37:02.535
was effectively the biggest
cover-up in human history?

688
00:37:04.838 --> 00:37:07.107
Biggest? Probably.

689
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.477
You had blood
on your hands, too.

690
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.413
Yeah, well,
anyone who follows orders

691
00:37:13.447 --> 00:37:16.550
pretty much always does,
don't they?

692
00:37:16.583 --> 00:37:20.154
That technology,
it's light years ahead of us.

693
00:37:20.188 --> 00:37:23.658
Compared to that,
we're the Stone Age.

694
00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:29.097
The only shot we had
to stop it

695
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.598
was Zulu X-Ray 7.

696
00:37:31.632 --> 00:37:34.468
It was shut down. Shelved.

697
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:37.005
For budgetary reasons.

698
00:37:37.038 --> 00:37:39.707
Well, Commander,
I have pressing business

699
00:37:39.741 --> 00:37:42.409
waiting for me on my desk.

700
00:37:43.878 --> 00:37:45.713
The sand in the hourglass

701
00:37:45.747 --> 00:37:48.515
is dropping quickly
for all of us.

702
00:37:48.548 --> 00:37:50.818
It's as good as gone.

703
00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:52.687
I'm really sorry.

704
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:55.023
Really.

705
00:38:08.003 --> 00:38:09.004
Damn it.

706
00:38:10.873 --> 00:38:12.540
What's wrong?

707
00:38:12.573 --> 00:38:13.976
I can't reach my son.

708
00:38:14.009 --> 00:38:15.110
Uh...

709
00:38:15.144 --> 00:38:17.913
Word is, um,
you're an astronaut,

710
00:38:18.747 --> 00:38:20.683
so you must know that

711
00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:23.986
the entire inside
of the Moon

712
00:38:24.019 --> 00:38:26.188
is full of produce.

713
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:27.923
KC, can you tell
Birkenstocks here

714
00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:30.125
that I'm dangerously close
to hurling him out a window?

715
00:38:30.159 --> 00:38:32.861
Okay, well,
let's find an empty room.

716
00:38:32.895 --> 00:38:34.964
How do you think
the Incas got their potatoes?

717
00:38:35.731 --> 00:38:37.166
Sorry.

718
00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:38.968
You said that if we can
destroy this thing...

719
00:38:39.001 --> 00:38:40.970
We have a theory

720
00:38:41.003 --> 00:38:43.604
that the Moon might return
to its original orbit.

721
00:38:43.638 --> 00:38:46.843
And how do you propose
we do that exactly?

722
00:38:46.876 --> 00:38:48.144
You said so yourself,

723
00:38:48.178 --> 00:38:51.181
using a modern spacecraft
is not feasible.

724
00:38:51.214 --> 00:38:53.016
I am working on a solution.

725
00:38:53.049 --> 00:38:54.550
We appreciate your effort,

726
00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:56.219
but this is now
a military operation.

727
00:38:56.252 --> 00:38:58.221
We'll take it from here.

728
00:39:01.858 --> 00:39:03.693
Doug! Wait!

729
00:39:03.727 --> 00:39:05.862
If you launch nukes,

730
00:39:05.895 --> 00:39:08.530
the global fallout
is gonna kill everybody.

731
00:39:08.564 --> 00:39:10.066
Who said anything about nukes?

732
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.669
You are making
a big mistake here.

733
00:39:12.702 --> 00:39:14.671
Please,
let me put together a plan.

734
00:39:14.704 --> 00:39:16.172
We have a plan.

735
00:39:18.775 --> 00:39:23.880
Look, why don't you and Jimmy
come with me to Colorado?

736
00:39:23.913 --> 00:39:25.647
You'll be safe there.

737
00:39:25.682 --> 00:39:28.584
What are you asking me to do?
Quit? Give up?

738
00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:30.954
I'm asking you
to think about our son.

739
00:39:30.987 --> 00:39:34.825
I am thinking about our son.

740
00:39:42.033 --> 00:39:43.267
Where is he?

741
00:39:44.301 --> 00:39:45.736
Uh, jail.

742
00:39:47.872 --> 00:39:49.840
He's a good kid,
just made a mistake.

743
00:39:49.874 --> 00:39:52.810
I was always
doing stupid things.

744
00:39:52.843 --> 00:39:55.046
Don't know how my parents
put up with me.

745
00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.814
We never had a lot of money,

746
00:39:56.847 --> 00:39:58.983
but sometimes
we'd all get fish 'n chips,

747
00:39:59.016 --> 00:40:00.151
sit out on the dock

748
00:40:00.184 --> 00:40:03.020
and just watch the stars
for hours.

749
00:40:04.955 --> 00:40:06.991
That was when I first dreamed
of being an astronaut.

750
00:40:08.859 --> 00:40:12.663
After my father passed,

751
00:40:12.696 --> 00:40:16.233
my mum wanted to move
back to the States.

752
00:40:16.267 --> 00:40:19.804
My dad laughed when I told him
I wanted to be an astronaut.

753
00:40:19.837 --> 00:40:21.604
Didn't believe in you?

754
00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:23.842
Oh, that's putting it lightly.

755
00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:26.945
I worked my ass off
to get into NASA.

756
00:40:26.978 --> 00:40:28.947
I read all about
your last mission.

757
00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.916
You saw alien tech.

758
00:40:30.949 --> 00:40:33.051
And NASA insisted
it was a meteor.

759
00:40:33.852 --> 00:40:35.253
But it wasn't?

760
00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:37.722
It was unlike anything
I'd ever seen.

761
00:40:37.756 --> 00:40:39.024
And, you know,
the worst part

762
00:40:40.358 --> 00:40:42.894
is I lost a friend up there.

763
00:40:42.928 --> 00:40:44.162
And it was my fault.

764
00:40:44.196 --> 00:40:45.864
Oh, come on.
How was it your fault?

765
00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:48.400
You saved the shuttle.
You saved Fowler.

766
00:40:48.433 --> 00:40:49.901
A lot of good that did.

767
00:40:49.935 --> 00:40:52.204
I'm divorced, broke,
my son hates me.

768
00:40:52.237 --> 00:40:54.206
God, I am so jealous.

769
00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:57.209
Alien tech.

770
00:40:57.242 --> 00:40:58.376
It's freakin' awesome.

771
00:41:05.317 --> 00:41:06.885
Extreme weather
is hammering

772
00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:09.221
the Eastern Seaboard
and Gulf Coast

773
00:41:09.254 --> 00:41:11.057
with high tides and flooding

774
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.693
wreaking havoc
on residents and properties.

775
00:41:13.726 --> 00:41:15.394
Folks, if you aren't
already on high ground,

776
00:41:15.428 --> 00:41:16.863
you better get there
as soon as possible.

777
00:41:16.896 --> 00:41:19.165
Um,
as an exchange student,

778
00:41:19.198 --> 00:41:21.767
are you sure they're going
to let me into the bunker?

779
00:41:21.801 --> 00:41:23.703
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

780
00:41:23.736 --> 00:41:25.371
Thank you.

781
00:41:25.404 --> 00:41:27.240
...and loss of life
in populated areas.

782
00:41:27.273 --> 00:41:29.008
As you can see, the images
coming out of Bangladesh

783
00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:32.178
- are simply horrific
- Mom, are we gonna die?

784
00:41:32.211 --> 00:41:33.913
No. No, sweetheart.

785
00:41:33.946 --> 00:41:35.882
I know all of this
that's happening

786
00:41:35.915 --> 00:41:37.016
seems so scary,

787
00:41:37.049 --> 00:41:39.418
but we are not
gonna die. Okay?

788
00:41:39.452 --> 00:41:41.687
We're all gonna be safe
with Dad in Colorado.

789
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:43.890
Are you sending more
rockets to the Moon?

790
00:41:44.724 --> 00:41:46.459
No. No. You know why?

791
00:41:46.492 --> 00:41:47.894
Because we don't...

792
00:41:47.927 --> 00:41:48.961
we don't have
any more of these.

793
00:41:48.995 --> 00:41:50.196
Why not?

794
00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:52.165
Because they're all
in museums.

795
00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:55.768
And, um...

796
00:41:56.969 --> 00:41:58.005
Uh...

797
00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.408
I love you, sweetheart.

798
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.378
Hey, Doug.

799
00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:07.247
What is a ZX-7?

800
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:08.782
Who told you about that?

801
00:42:08.815 --> 00:42:10.350
Well, come on.
What is it?

802
00:42:10.384 --> 00:42:15.389
Zulu X-Ray Seven
was a prototype EMP device.

803
00:42:15.422 --> 00:42:17.191
But the program got disbanded.

804
00:42:17.224 --> 00:42:20.294
Okay, well, it's clear that
this thing inside the Moon

805
00:42:20.327 --> 00:42:22.229
is technological
in nature, right?

806
00:42:22.262 --> 00:42:24.498
I assume they thought an EMP
could take the thing out.

807
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:27.334
We don't have a way into space
so this is a moot point.

808
00:42:27.367 --> 00:42:29.770
Okay, well, how far along
was the testing?

809
00:42:31.772 --> 00:42:34.241
Jocinda, NASA isn't cleared
for another mission.

810
00:42:34.274 --> 00:42:36.210
How about you let me
worry about that?

811
00:42:41.315 --> 00:42:43.083
GPS is locked on LZ.

812
00:42:43.116 --> 00:42:45.954
Compensate latitude
by minus 4.5 west.

813
00:42:45.987 --> 00:42:48.389
4.5 degrees. Copy.

814
00:42:48.423 --> 00:42:50.124
Reducing to 10 knots.

815
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.172
Open the door.

816
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.242
Yeah?

817
00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:09.244
- Brian Harper?
- Yeah.

818
00:43:09.277 --> 00:43:10.545
We need you to come with us.

819
00:43:10.578 --> 00:43:12.513
It's a matter
of national security.

820
00:43:12.547 --> 00:43:14.816
All right.
Give me a second.

821
00:43:14.849 --> 00:43:16.317
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

822
00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:18.186
Yeah, we're a team.

823
00:43:22.423 --> 00:43:24.459
Oh.
Sorry, I'm sorry, miss.

824
00:43:26.494 --> 00:43:27.495
Sorry.

825
00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:33.268
Oh, sorry, sorry.

826
00:43:35.838 --> 00:43:39.108
It's been nearly three hours.
That can't be a good sign.

827
00:43:40.976 --> 00:43:42.211
What's with
all the pill popping?

828
00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:43.245
You're really sweating
over there.

829
00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:45.481
- You okay?
- Yeah.

830
00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:52.821
No. I broke into UC Irvine
multiple times.

831
00:43:52.855 --> 00:43:54.156
I lost two of their mops.

832
00:43:56.558 --> 00:43:58.093
They probably know.

833
00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:03.999
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me. No.

834
00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:05.601
Look, I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

835
00:44:05.634 --> 00:44:07.336
Sit down.

836
00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:09.405
No, no, no. I don't have to
take orders from you anymore.

837
00:44:09.438 --> 00:44:11.607
I'm just curious, you still
screwing over your friends?

838
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.342
- Oh, you talking about me?
- How many of these

839
00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:14.576
- wonderful people here...
- Really?

840
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.878
Guys!

841
00:44:19.348 --> 00:44:20.482
Who the hell is this?

842
00:44:22.185 --> 00:44:25.255
Dr. KC Houseman, ma'am.

843
00:44:25.288 --> 00:44:28.925
I wrote you several e-mails,
but you never responded.

844
00:44:32.162 --> 00:44:33.530
What's this all about?

845
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.432
Follow me.

846
00:44:39.636 --> 00:44:41.137
What you're about to see,

847
00:44:41.171 --> 00:44:43.139
only a handful of people
have ever seen before.

848
00:44:43.173 --> 00:44:44.407
KC knew the Moon
was out of orbit

849
00:44:44.441 --> 00:44:45.975
before you guys did.

850
00:44:46.009 --> 00:44:50.113
Social media went wild
when I posted my research.

851
00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:51.548
You're the
"unidentified source"?

852
00:44:51.581 --> 00:44:52.849
Oh, yes.

853
00:44:53.583 --> 00:44:54.918
Oh, God.

854
00:44:57.253 --> 00:45:00.056
Mosley, pull up
the tunnel, please.

855
00:45:02.592 --> 00:45:04.294
Our readings
estimate its depth

856
00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:06.496
to be over 25 kilometers.

857
00:45:06.529 --> 00:45:07.597
That's the Mare Crisium.

858
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.132
Exactly.

859
00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:11.068
I think whatever happened
all those years ago

860
00:45:11.102 --> 00:45:12.169
is directly responsible

861
00:45:12.203 --> 00:45:13.304
for what's happening
right now.

862
00:45:13.337 --> 00:45:15.039
Oh, so you believe me now?

863
00:45:15.072 --> 00:45:16.540
I saw your helmet cam.

864
00:45:16.574 --> 00:45:18.275
It's a little late
for an apology.

865
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:20.411
We were both lied to.

866
00:45:20.444 --> 00:45:23.080
The international mission
didn't just go sideways.

867
00:45:23.114 --> 00:45:24.382
It was attacked.

868
00:45:24.415 --> 00:45:27.251
A technological life form.

869
00:45:27.284 --> 00:45:28.986
No effin' way.

870
00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:30.654
During the attack,
the Moon was attempting

871
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:32.356
to return
to its original orbit,

872
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.559
until this thing
went back inside the Moon.

873
00:45:35.593 --> 00:45:38.529
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

874
00:45:38.562 --> 00:45:40.699
It's doing something to the
megastructure's power core.

875
00:45:40.732 --> 00:45:42.166
Excuse me.
The megastructure?

876
00:45:42.199 --> 00:45:43.567
Please don't ask.

877
00:45:43.601 --> 00:45:46.337
It's highly likely our
Moon was built by aliens.

878
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.572
We have to get inside
and make first contact.

879
00:45:48.606 --> 00:45:49.640
I told you not to ask.

880
00:45:49.674 --> 00:45:51.175
All right, look,

881
00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:52.977
we're planning a mission
to attack this thing.

882
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.311
The only problem is,

883
00:45:54.345 --> 00:45:56.614
is it recognizes
our technology.

884
00:45:57.582 --> 00:46:01.186
Which is why we need you.

885
00:46:01.219 --> 00:46:03.922
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that again.

886
00:46:04.623 --> 00:46:06.091
You're the only pilot

887
00:46:06.124 --> 00:46:07.392
to ever land a shuttle
without power.

888
00:46:07.426 --> 00:46:09.494
Not exactly a hirable skill.

889
00:46:09.528 --> 00:46:11.129
Well, it is right now,

890
00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:14.566
which is why I'm offering
you your job back,

891
00:46:14.599 --> 00:46:18.937
and I'm personally
asking you for your help.

892
00:46:20.305 --> 00:46:21.640
Say yes, Brian.

893
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.048
I don't know.

894
00:46:30.081 --> 00:46:32.284
I got a lot of my own
problems down here.

895
00:46:32.317 --> 00:46:35.587
And the Moon
falling onto Earth

896
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.690
isn't one of them?

897
00:46:37.723 --> 00:46:41.092
I was wrong to bring you here.
I am done.

898
00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:42.762
How do you plan
on getting up there?

899
00:46:42.795 --> 00:46:46.032
You know all of our shuttles
are in museums.

900
00:46:46.065 --> 00:46:47.701
The Endeavour
is right here in L.A.

901
00:46:47.734 --> 00:46:51.204
Plus, the Chinese are offering
their prototype moon lander.

902
00:46:51.237 --> 00:46:53.105
I know it sounds
completely crazy.

903
00:46:53.139 --> 00:46:55.041
No, no,
what you showed us was crazy.

904
00:46:55.074 --> 00:46:58.044
This is a whole other
level of insane.

905
00:46:58.077 --> 00:47:00.146
Ought to be right up
your alley then, no?

906
00:47:02.148 --> 00:47:03.149
If I do this,

907
00:47:05.084 --> 00:47:07.220
I'm gonna need
something in return.

908
00:47:10.323 --> 00:47:12.492
Clear!
All clear over here.

909
00:47:12.525 --> 00:47:14.460
Staircase on your left.

910
00:47:14.494 --> 00:47:15.762
Keep your eyes open.

911
00:47:18.197 --> 00:47:19.632
Did you reach him?

912
00:47:19.666 --> 00:47:22.568
Yeah. It's being handled.

913
00:47:22.602 --> 00:47:24.771
Sonny's gonna meet us
at Vandenberg.

914
00:47:24.805 --> 00:47:27.073
Looks like
we missed the party.

915
00:47:27.106 --> 00:47:28.508
I didn't even
get an invite.

916
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:32.713
At least somebody's
on the same page as us.

917
00:47:37.785 --> 00:47:40.688
Hey, hey. Look what I found!

918
00:47:40.722 --> 00:47:42.523
Maybe we can use it
as toilet paper.

919
00:47:42.556 --> 00:47:44.826
- What?
- Take a look around you, man.

920
00:47:44.859 --> 00:47:47.394
- It's worthless.
- Whatever. Let's go.

921
00:47:48.696 --> 00:47:50.531
Attention,

922
00:47:50.564 --> 00:47:53.400
we are asking everyone
to please clear the streets

923
00:47:53.433 --> 00:47:56.270
and to remain indoors...

924
00:47:56.303 --> 00:47:58.071
Dude, dude, we gotta
get outta here. Go!

925
00:48:06.814 --> 00:48:10.183
Yeah. This is really,
really exciting, isn't it?

926
00:48:13.554 --> 00:48:15.122
As leaders
around the world

927
00:48:15.155 --> 00:48:16.691
struggle for answers,

928
00:48:16.724 --> 00:48:19.226
new images have surfaced
suggesting that NASA

929
00:48:19.259 --> 00:48:21.496
might have plans
for a new lunar mission.

930
00:48:21.529 --> 00:48:23.464
But so far, NASA
and the White House

931
00:48:23.498 --> 00:48:25.668
have not responded
to requests for comment.

932
00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:27.335
And this is just in

933
00:48:27.368 --> 00:48:29.370
from our correspondent
in Southeast Asia.

934
00:48:29.404 --> 00:48:31.874
Apparently, the Moon
is causing a drastic increase

935
00:48:31.907 --> 00:48:33.641
in tectonic activity.

936
00:48:33.676 --> 00:48:35.443
Reports of
countless earthquakes

937
00:48:35.476 --> 00:48:37.612
and volcanic eruptions
keep pouring in.

938
00:48:37.645 --> 00:48:39.447
That's weird.

939
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.349
What's weird?

940
00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:43.117
The Moon doesn't have
enough gravity to do that,

941
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:44.687
no matter how close it gets.

942
00:48:45.688 --> 00:48:47.322
You still don't get it.

943
00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:49.490
We're dealing
with a megastructure.

944
00:48:49.524 --> 00:48:52.728
Your rules
don't apply anymore.

945
00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:54.763
We've been here
how long now,

946
00:48:54.797 --> 00:48:57.700
and nobody's bothered
to paint over that?

947
00:48:57.733 --> 00:48:59.400
It's kinda growing on me.

948
00:49:00.234 --> 00:49:01.569
Hey, where's Sonny?

949
00:49:01.603 --> 00:49:02.905
I sent a ground crew
to the prison, okay?

950
00:49:02.938 --> 00:49:04.807
But I haven't heard anything
in a few days.

951
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.341
Why the hell
didn't you say that?

952
00:49:06.374 --> 00:49:07.609
'Cause I need you
to be focused

953
00:49:07.642 --> 00:49:09.278
on what's happening
right here.

954
00:49:12.682 --> 00:49:14.483
Megastructures
move through space

955
00:49:14.516 --> 00:49:15.785
without an exhaust system.

956
00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:17.553
The Moon has an engine?

957
00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:20.790
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

958
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.862
Well, at least your husband
came through with that.

959
00:49:25.895 --> 00:49:27.529
Ex-husband.

960
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:40.777
- Colonel.
- Director Fowler.

961
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.712
Commander Harper.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Reed.

962
00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:44.580
This is Captain Avery.

963
00:49:44.613 --> 00:49:46.415
We've been briefed
by General Davidson.

964
00:49:46.448 --> 00:49:48.617
We need to walk you
through the arming procedure.

965
00:49:48.651 --> 00:49:50.552
I'm an astronaut,
not a soldier.

966
00:49:50.586 --> 00:49:51.821
I'll get you
where you need to go,

967
00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:53.188
but I'm not setting off
any bomb.

968
00:49:53.222 --> 00:49:54.490
We don't expect you to.

969
00:49:54.523 --> 00:49:55.959
We'll accompany you
on the mission

970
00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.594
and activate the device,

971
00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:58.829
but you need to be familiar
with the process

972
00:49:58.863 --> 00:50:00.397
should complications arise.

973
00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:05.635
The bomb's security
and authentication systems

974
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.804
have been removed.

975
00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.238
Meaning we can arm it

976
00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:09.539
without approval
from the ground.

977
00:50:09.572 --> 00:50:11.574
Using a remote trigger.

978
00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:14.644
Two clicks,
then push this down and hold.

979
00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:16.179
Triggers the device to go off.

980
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.717
- Simple.
- Yeah. Simple.

981
00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:27.223
Nearing Vandenberg, Captain.
Over.

982
00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:28.458
Roger that.

983
00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.265
Should've gotten you
the jumbo platter.

984
00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:37.600
Thank you for getting me out.

985
00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.769
You can thank your dad.

986
00:50:44.008 --> 00:50:45.443
Plan is to take off

987
00:50:45.476 --> 00:50:47.311
when the Moon
is closest to Earth.

988
00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:49.547
Now, since we're dealing
with an unpredictable target,

989
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.515
navigation
is gonna be crucial.

990
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.318
Our navigator, Carl Saunders,

991
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:56.021
is gonna be making sure
we hit the mark,

992
00:50:56.054 --> 00:50:57.455
flight engineer Hannah Martin

993
00:50:57.488 --> 00:50:59.457
will run
real-time calculations

994
00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:01.993
to ensure
that we intercept the Moon.

995
00:51:02.027 --> 00:51:03.494
And once
we clear the atmosphere,

996
00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:05.262
we'll begin
the refueling process.

997
00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:07.398
Thankfully
our friends at SpaceX

998
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.901
have a propellant depot
currently in orbit.

999
00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:11.402
I love Elon.

1000
00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:16.407
So once
we're all powered off,

1001
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.342
we'll use our thrusters
to position ourselves

1002
00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:19.745
over the Mare Crisium.

1003
00:51:19.778 --> 00:51:21.278
Our Chinese friends

1004
00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:22.881
have jerry-rigged
the onboard systems

1005
00:51:22.914 --> 00:51:25.583
so that we can fly it
without electronics.

1006
00:51:25.616 --> 00:51:27.585
So we'll park the rover
section of the module

1007
00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:29.353
with the bomb inside,

1008
00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:31.957
then switch the electronics
back on

1009
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:33.425
and use it as bait

1010
00:51:33.458 --> 00:51:35.895
to lure this thing
out of its hole.

1011
00:51:35.928 --> 00:51:38.563
Then, you guys
will pull the trigger

1012
00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:40.700
and kill it.

1013
00:51:42.567 --> 00:51:45.637
And then, hopefully,
we all can go back home.

1014
00:51:45.671 --> 00:51:47.472
If we still have one left.

1015
00:51:49.976 --> 00:51:51.409
What did I say?

1016
00:51:51.443 --> 00:51:54.080
Sonny. Oh, my God, son.

1017
00:51:54.113 --> 00:51:55.748
- Thank God you're okay.
- Thank you.

1018
00:51:57.415 --> 00:51:58.684
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1019
00:51:58.718 --> 00:51:59.986
Just so I'm clear,

1020
00:52:00.019 --> 00:52:01.854
you're gonna take
a bomb into space.

1021
00:52:01.888 --> 00:52:05.323
And why are you even here?
You hate NASA.

1022
00:52:05.357 --> 00:52:07.026
Just try to understand.
If there's even

1023
00:52:07.059 --> 00:52:08.694
the smallest chance
that this could work...

1024
00:52:08.728 --> 00:52:12.430
- What if it doesn't?
- It has to.

1025
00:52:12.464 --> 00:52:14.901
I want you to have a world
you can grow up in.

1026
00:52:14.934 --> 00:52:17.469
Where you can be
a better man than me.

1027
00:52:20.039 --> 00:52:22.042
Hey.

1028
00:52:24.477 --> 00:52:26.412
What have you seen
since you've been there?

1029
00:52:26.445 --> 00:52:28.548
The space shuttle and stuff.

1030
00:52:28.581 --> 00:52:29.883
Do you miss me?

1031
00:52:29.917 --> 00:52:31.919
Yeah, I really miss you.

1032
00:52:31.952 --> 00:52:34.087
I miss you too, my little man.

1033
00:52:34.121 --> 00:52:35.521
Is Mom around?

1034
00:52:38.792 --> 00:52:40.526
Mom, it's Dad.

1035
00:52:41.976 --> 00:52:43.202
Hey, Commander Fowler.

1036
00:52:43.282 --> 00:52:44.977
Let's go practice refueling in Zero G.

1037
00:52:45.075 --> 00:52:46.724
Okay, I'm coming.

1038
00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.869
Wow, he's getting good.

1039
00:52:49.502 --> 00:52:50.704
Yeah?

1040
00:52:50.737 --> 00:52:53.674
I held up my end
of the bargain.

1041
00:52:53.707 --> 00:52:55.575
I want you and Jimmy
in Colorado.

1042
00:52:55.608 --> 00:52:57.811
We are. We're gonna be
airlifted out of here

1043
00:52:57.845 --> 00:52:59.847
as soon
as the shuttle launches.

1044
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.414
Look, if anyone finds out

1045
00:53:01.447 --> 00:53:03.583
- what I've done for you...
- They won't.

1046
00:53:03.616 --> 00:53:06.687
You just make sure
your trigger-happy buddies

1047
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.554
keep their hands
off the nukes.

1048
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.862
Sorry, guys.

1049
00:53:13.895 --> 00:53:16.030
Out of two percent.
I looked everywhere.

1050
00:53:16.064 --> 00:53:18.665
Nah, this is great.
Thanks, man.

1051
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.935
You know,
I almost got a job at NASA.

1052
00:53:20.969 --> 00:53:22.603
What department?

1053
00:53:22.636 --> 00:53:23.637
Janitorial.

1054
00:53:34.648 --> 00:53:35.750
Get out!

1055
00:53:37.819 --> 00:53:39.020
Hang on!

1056
00:53:52.834 --> 00:53:55.069
Is this your current
projected lunar orbit?

1057
00:53:55.103 --> 00:53:56.603
- Yeah.
- Why?

1058
00:53:56.637 --> 00:53:57.773
This obviously
isn't accounting

1059
00:53:57.806 --> 00:53:59.909
for the Moon's increased mass.

1060
00:53:59.942 --> 00:54:01.476
Look at
all this seismic activity

1061
00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:03.712
in the wake of its orbit.

1062
00:54:03.746 --> 00:54:05.848
We know
the Moon's surface gravity

1063
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:07.917
is 1.62 meters squared.

1064
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:09.417
At least it used to be.

1065
00:54:10.119 --> 00:54:12.755
So this must be wrong.

1066
00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:19.929
I'm sorry, Director Fowler,

1067
00:54:19.962 --> 00:54:21.230
we have a problem.

1068
00:54:21.263 --> 00:54:22.998
Just what we need,
a damn earthquake.

1069
00:54:23.032 --> 00:54:24.632
We're losing coolant.

1070
00:54:24.666 --> 00:54:26.168
Well, there has to be
a way to fix it.

1071
00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:28.170
Not here. We would need
the entire team at Michoud

1072
00:54:28.203 --> 00:54:29.637
to rebuild
something like this.

1073
00:54:29.672 --> 00:54:30.906
Well, then get on the horn

1074
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.473
and find somebody
who can help us.

1075
00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:35.010
Anyone that can help us
is already here.

1076
00:54:41.616 --> 00:54:42.818
Look,

1077
00:54:42.851 --> 00:54:44.552
we have to think about

1078
00:54:44.585 --> 00:54:46.723
letting all
of these people here

1079
00:54:46.756 --> 00:54:47.924
get to safety.

1080
00:54:47.958 --> 00:54:49.558
To safety?

1081
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:51.527
These people here
won't have a planet

1082
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.495
unless we figure
something out.

1083
00:54:53.529 --> 00:54:55.631
Brian, we're down an engine.

1084
00:54:56.866 --> 00:54:59.002
Launching is no longer
an option.

1085
00:54:59.035 --> 00:55:00.804
Thanks for bringing me here.

1086
00:55:08.211 --> 00:55:09.611
May I have
everyone's attention.

1087
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:15.885
You've all done more
than we ever could have asked.

1088
00:55:15.919 --> 00:55:18.788
You have my deepest thanks

1089
00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:21.958
along with the thanks
of the entire country.

1090
00:55:21.992 --> 00:55:24.761
But it's now time
for you to go home.

1091
00:55:24.794 --> 00:55:27.563
I'm ordering
the immediate evacuation

1092
00:55:27.596 --> 00:55:29.899
of all personnel
from Vandenberg.

1093
00:55:29.933 --> 00:55:33.004
You'll meet up with
your families in Colorado.

1094
00:55:35.006 --> 00:55:36.073
Dad.

1095
00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:38.508
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1096
00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:41.145
Story of my life.

1097
00:55:42.913 --> 00:55:44.982
Thanks for getting me
out of jail.

1098
00:55:47.785 --> 00:55:49.619
Let's get our stuff.
It's time to go.

1099
00:55:58.195 --> 00:55:59.629
Time's up.

1100
00:55:59.662 --> 00:56:01.298
Chopper's ready.
Come on. Let's go.

1101
00:56:07.304 --> 00:56:08.839
Go ahead.
I'll meet you out there.

1102
00:56:08.873 --> 00:56:10.107
Why are you guys still here?

1103
00:56:10.141 --> 00:56:12.642
Director Fowler,
when it comes back around,

1104
00:56:12.676 --> 00:56:15.246
the Moon's gravity will be
over 80% of the Earth's pull.

1105
00:56:15.279 --> 00:56:16.714
I know how it sounds,

1106
00:56:16.747 --> 00:56:17.915
but we checked
Dr. Houseman's data.

1107
00:56:17.948 --> 00:56:19.250
The numbers are solid.

1108
00:56:19.283 --> 00:56:20.986
Show the director
our new simulations.

1109
00:56:21.019 --> 00:56:22.687
We have to pull up
our launch window.

1110
00:56:22.721 --> 00:56:25.257
Guys, where have
you been? Look.

1111
00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:28.927
There is no launch window.

1112
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.796
The mission's over.

1113
00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:40.038
Wait. Wait a minute.

1114
00:56:53.718 --> 00:56:55.020
How do you feel
about flying the shuttle

1115
00:56:55.053 --> 00:56:56.721
with only two engines?

1116
00:56:56.755 --> 00:56:58.390
It can't be done.

1117
00:56:58.423 --> 00:57:00.058
If we launch when the Moon
is directly above us,

1118
00:57:00.092 --> 00:57:01.726
the increased
gravitational pull

1119
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.328
should give
the shuttle a boost,

1120
00:57:03.361 --> 00:57:04.830
giving you a really good
chance of getting into orbit.

1121
00:57:04.863 --> 00:57:06.898
You evacuated
my entire flight crew.

1122
00:57:06.932 --> 00:57:09.068
I can't fly the shuttle alone.

1123
00:57:09.102 --> 00:57:10.837
That's why I'm
going with you.

1124
00:57:13.172 --> 00:57:14.841
My guys will stay back
and handle the launch.

1125
00:57:14.874 --> 00:57:17.043
But we've got a very narrow
window of time here.

1126
00:57:17.076 --> 00:57:19.779
You'd have to be ready to go
in exactly 28 minutes.

1127
00:57:19.812 --> 00:57:22.181
You fly and I'll navigate.

1128
00:57:22.215 --> 00:57:24.684
Just like old times.

1129
00:57:24.717 --> 00:57:26.719
- What do you say?
- What about the EMP device?

1130
00:57:26.752 --> 00:57:27.987
It's still in the Moon Lander.

1131
00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.288
I mean, we lost the crew

1132
00:57:29.322 --> 00:57:30.323
so we're gonna have
to set it off ourselves,

1133
00:57:30.356 --> 00:57:33.059
but you paid attention, right?

1134
00:57:33.092 --> 00:57:36.062
Two clicks, then press
the button down and hold.

1135
00:57:36.095 --> 00:57:39.065
Triggers the device
to go off. Simple.

1136
00:57:40.099 --> 00:57:42.201
You figured all this out?

1137
00:57:42.235 --> 00:57:45.171
And he calculated
our new launch trajectory.

1138
00:57:45.204 --> 00:57:46.973
You know, without electronics,

1139
00:57:47.006 --> 00:57:48.274
we're gonna need to make

1140
00:57:48.307 --> 00:57:50.810
split-second calculations
up there.

1141
00:57:50.843 --> 00:57:53.012
Plus, we lost
our flight engineer.

1142
00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:54.046
Mm.

1143
00:57:56.249 --> 00:57:58.418
No. No, no, no, guys.

1144
00:57:59.419 --> 00:58:00.921
I'm not cleared for this.

1145
00:58:00.954 --> 00:58:03.190
Well, I'm the
acting director of NASA,

1146
00:58:03.223 --> 00:58:05.792
so I just cleared you.
Congrats.

1147
00:58:05.826 --> 00:58:07.027
Yeah, but...

1148
00:58:10.297 --> 00:58:11.765
I've got IBS.

1149
00:58:12.933 --> 00:58:15.002
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

1150
00:58:15.035 --> 00:58:17.104
- Mm.
- I get motion sickness, too.

1151
00:58:17.137 --> 00:58:19.139
You said you always wanted
to be an astronaut.

1152
00:58:21.308 --> 00:58:23.944
I have debilitating anxiety.

1153
00:58:23.977 --> 00:58:26.914
KC, if the Moon really
is what you think it is,

1154
00:58:26.947 --> 00:58:28.448
we're gonna need
a megastructurist.

1155
00:58:30.117 --> 00:58:31.385
Suit up.

1156
00:58:36.023 --> 00:58:37.691
That's great.
Let's move, move!

1157
00:58:41.428 --> 00:58:44.431
So, I've put your
dad's number in here, okay?

1158
00:58:44.464 --> 00:58:46.467
He knows you're coming.

1159
00:58:46.501 --> 00:58:48.436
I know I wasn't always easy.

1160
00:58:48.469 --> 00:58:50.238
That makes two of us.

1161
00:58:53.341 --> 00:58:57.011
You know this was
all your idea, right?

1162
00:58:57.045 --> 00:58:59.113
You're so smart.

1163
00:58:59.147 --> 00:59:01.149
But now,
I need you to be brave.

1164
00:59:01.182 --> 00:59:02.817
I don't want you to go.

1165
00:59:03.551 --> 00:59:05.286
I love you

1166
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.822
more than
all the stars in the sky.

1167
00:59:07.855 --> 00:59:09.924
Even more
than the whole Milky Way?

1168
00:59:11.059 --> 00:59:12.393
Way more.

1169
00:59:15.196 --> 00:59:16.431
Way more.

1170
00:59:22.237 --> 00:59:23.771
Take good care of him.

1171
00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.476
Be safe up there.

1172
00:59:28.509 --> 00:59:31.246
Take this.
I hope you don't need it.

1173
00:59:31.279 --> 00:59:33.082
Stay off the main roads.

1174
00:59:36.385 --> 00:59:37.920
- Dad, I...
- Go.

1175
00:59:42.057 --> 00:59:43.225
Uh...

1176
00:59:43.259 --> 00:59:45.894
You do know
how to start a car, right?

1177
00:59:47.263 --> 00:59:51.166
I should warn you.
My license has been revoked.

1178
01:00:02.278 --> 01:00:04.113
We need to go now.

1179
01:00:10.953 --> 01:00:13.389
Mum, you're never gonna
believe where I'm going.

1180
01:00:13.422 --> 01:00:16.191
Jack, when are you
coming home for supper?

1181
01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:19.461
Mum, this is KC. Your son.

1182
01:00:19.495 --> 01:00:23.099
You told me to make them
listen, and they did.

1183
01:00:23.133 --> 01:00:25.235
Where'd you get these suits
from? A thrift shop?

1184
01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:28.505
Early Apollo.
No electronics, we should be okay.

1185
01:00:28.538 --> 01:00:30.473
"Should be"?
That's encouraging.

1186
01:00:30.507 --> 01:00:32.375
Let's go. Let's go.

1187
01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:33.610
Mrs. Houseman,
we need to leave.

1188
01:00:33.643 --> 01:00:35.011
Oh.

1189
01:00:35.045 --> 01:00:38.548
Mum?
Let me speak to the nurse.

1190
01:00:38.581 --> 01:00:40.183
- Hello?
- Are you evacuating?

1191
01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:41.951
Any minute now.

1192
01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:43.286
Please take care of my mum.

1193
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.322
Of course.

1194
01:00:46.956 --> 01:00:49.159
Sir, we have to hurry.

1195
01:01:02.605 --> 01:01:04.874
This is gonna be
really tight, okay?

1196
01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:10.247
Turn on APU one,
two and three.

1197
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:11.916
APUs active.

1198
01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:15.920
Reaction Control System,
active.

1199
01:01:15.953 --> 01:01:18.589
Autopilot active.
T-minus 30.

1200
01:01:38.376 --> 01:01:39.678
Endeavour, you have got

1201
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:41.479
a big-ass gravity wave
coming your way.

1202
01:01:41.512 --> 01:01:43.414
You have to launch now. Over.

1203
01:01:43.447 --> 01:01:45.616
Did he say "gravity wave"?

1204
01:01:45.649 --> 01:01:48.285
Guys, get out.
T-minus ten,

1205
01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:51.088
nine, eight, seven...

1206
01:01:51.122 --> 01:01:52.523
Screw it, go for ignition.

1207
01:02:45.077 --> 01:02:46.078
This is gonna be close.

1208
01:02:53.787 --> 01:02:55.021
We're underwater, guys.

1209
01:03:19.512 --> 01:03:21.314
Get back in the car.

1210
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.307
Our ascent trajectory is off.

1211
01:03:48.675 --> 01:03:50.277
The right booster's
losing thrust.

1212
01:03:56.684 --> 01:03:58.485
Thruster's down to zero.

1213
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:04.726
We're drifting right.
We're at 11 degrees.

1214
01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:07.461
12. 13.

1215
01:04:10.297 --> 01:04:12.633
We better do something fast
or we're gonna crash down!

1216
01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.268
I knew
I should never have come!

1217
01:04:14.301 --> 01:04:15.837
Let's lose the other booster

1218
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:16.804
and see if the Moon can
pull us the rest of the way.

1219
01:04:16.838 --> 01:04:18.539
KC, can we do it?

1220
01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:21.543
- Uh... Um...
- Come on, buddy.

1221
01:04:21.576 --> 01:04:23.511
Current momentum... gravity...

1222
01:04:23.545 --> 01:04:25.280
- Can we do it?
- Oh, I don't know!

1223
01:04:25.313 --> 01:04:27.582
Go for SRB separation.

1224
01:04:27.615 --> 01:04:28.817
Completed.

1225
01:04:35.724 --> 01:04:37.860
Oh, God, if this doesn't work,
we're dead.

1226
01:04:37.893 --> 01:04:40.562
Well, yeah, this better work.

1227
01:04:40.595 --> 01:04:41.864
Main tank's
down to zero.

1228
01:04:41.897 --> 01:04:43.565
- Jo, get rid of it.
- Separating main tank.

1229
01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:54.175
Bri, we're going too slow.

1230
01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.277
We're not gonna make it.

1231
01:05:06.521 --> 01:05:08.657
Wait. Look at our velocity.

1232
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.762
It's still going up.

1233
01:05:41.223 --> 01:05:43.359
Uh... Guys...

1234
01:05:52.468 --> 01:05:53.903
Well,
we're about to end

1235
01:05:53.937 --> 01:05:56.406
our final broadcast here
on radio KSOQ.

1236
01:05:56.439 --> 01:05:58.642
Time to seek shelter,
hug your loved ones,

1237
01:05:58.675 --> 01:06:00.811
and make these
last moments count.

1238
01:06:00.845 --> 01:06:02.479
I'm gonna put
some oldies on a loop

1239
01:06:02.512 --> 01:06:03.814
to lighten up your mood.

1240
01:06:11.488 --> 01:06:12.489
What do those mean?

1241
01:06:14.859 --> 01:06:16.459
It's my parents' names.

1242
01:06:16.493 --> 01:06:18.328
I've got one kinda like it.

1243
01:06:19.462 --> 01:06:21.531
"Jonas Brothers"?

1244
01:06:22.499 --> 01:06:24.334
What?

1245
01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:26.269
Just messing with you.

1246
01:06:26.302 --> 01:06:27.337
Oh, my God.

1247
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.439
Your face was priceless.

1248
01:06:29.472 --> 01:06:31.441
Yeah, don't scare me
like that.

1249
01:06:33.476 --> 01:06:36.446
Hey, buddy, now's probably
a good time to call your dad.

1250
01:06:53.865 --> 01:06:55.701
- Dad?
- Hey, are you guys okay?

1251
01:06:55.734 --> 01:06:59.805
Yeah, Sonny drove fast away
from all the crazy water.

1252
01:06:59.838 --> 01:07:03.574
Drove? Who's Sonny?
Where's Mommy?

1253
01:07:03.607 --> 01:07:05.242
She stayed behind to help.

1254
01:07:07.478 --> 01:07:09.715
Hi, sir, this is
Brian Harper's son.

1255
01:07:09.748 --> 01:07:11.415
We're on our way to you.

1256
01:07:11.449 --> 01:07:12.583
We still have
a few hundred miles to go,

1257
01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:13.819
but we're making good time.

1258
01:07:13.852 --> 01:07:15.586
Security's
extremely tight here.

1259
01:07:15.619 --> 01:07:17.288
Call when you get close
so I can get you clearance.

1260
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:19.024
Will do.
Thank you so much, sir.

1261
01:07:19.057 --> 01:07:22.560
No, thank you
for looking after my son.

1262
01:07:28.632 --> 01:07:31.268
Okay, KC, very gently
with the maneuver

1263
01:07:31.302 --> 01:07:32.671
just like I showed you.

1264
01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:35.742
Okay. Very gently.

1265
01:07:35.775 --> 01:07:38.243
Sure. I can do that.

1266
01:07:40.713 --> 01:07:41.714
Careful.

1267
01:07:43.648 --> 01:07:45.584
Now switch
to station-keeping mode,

1268
01:07:45.617 --> 01:07:47.385
and we'll take it from here.

1269
01:07:47.419 --> 01:07:49.055
I can't believe
I just did that.

1270
01:07:49.088 --> 01:07:51.490
You sure
you've never done this before?

1271
01:07:51.523 --> 01:07:54.794
When I was 10, I dressed up
as an astronaut for Halloween.

1272
01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:56.896
Scottie Ebersol told me
I'd never go to space

1273
01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:57.997
'cause I was too chubby.

1274
01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:01.666
If only Scottie Ebersol
could see you now.

1275
01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:04.704
Okay, KC,
open the fueling valves

1276
01:08:04.737 --> 01:08:06.571
on the shuttle tank.

1277
01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:09.474
It's those little switches
that say fueling valves.

1278
01:08:09.508 --> 01:08:12.410
Roger.
Fueling valves wide open.

1279
01:08:12.444 --> 01:08:13.478
Perfect.

1280
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.053
I have a confession to make.

1281
01:08:20.087 --> 01:08:22.321
I didn't know if you'd be able
to follow through

1282
01:08:22.355 --> 01:08:24.825
with any of this, Bri.

1283
01:08:24.858 --> 01:08:27.761
You know, I have
a confession to make, too.

1284
01:08:27.795 --> 01:08:30.563
It is "I bless the rains
down in Africa."

1285
01:08:31.364 --> 01:08:32.498
I looked it up.

1286
01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:35.803
I told you.

1287
01:08:35.836 --> 01:08:39.072
KC, close
the fueling valves, please.

1288
01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:43.543
Fueling valves are closed.

1289
01:08:43.576 --> 01:08:44.644
Jo, turn around.

1290
01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:54.087
We need to go.

1291
01:08:54.121 --> 01:08:55.756
And I hope it's not too late.

1292
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:57.356
Yeah.

1293
01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.636
As the Moon's orbit

1294
01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.572
brings it closer
to the surface,

1295
01:09:11.605 --> 01:09:14.408
scientists have warned of
extreme gravitational effects.

1296
01:09:18.012 --> 01:09:19.479
Oh, what a night.

1297
01:09:20.882 --> 01:09:22.917
Hey, my car crapped out on me.

1298
01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:24.052
Do you think
you could give me a lift?

1299
01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:26.087
Out!

1300
01:09:26.821 --> 01:09:27.956
Now.

1301
01:09:31.025 --> 01:09:32.559
Don't make me ask twice!

1302
01:09:32.593 --> 01:09:33.627
Be cool. Be cool.

1303
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.468
Stop! Leave her alone.

1304
01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:42.636
All right. Turn around.

1305
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.173
What's in the bag, kid?

1306
01:09:45.335 --> 01:09:46.538
Just do what he says.

1307
01:09:46.619 --> 01:09:47.914
This guy is an idiot.

1308
01:09:47.992 --> 01:09:49.744
Enough of that gibberish.

1309
01:09:49.777 --> 01:09:51.179
- Hey, don't hurt him.
- Shut up.

1310
01:09:51.212 --> 01:09:52.579
All right, everyone calm down!

1311
01:09:52.613 --> 01:09:54.782
Oh, look at Mr. Smartass.

1312
01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:57.720
Are you a college boy?

1313
01:09:57.753 --> 01:09:58.988
All right. Let's roll.

1314
01:09:59.021 --> 01:10:00.488
Come on.

1315
01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:09.164
The phone is still
in Jimmy's backpack.

1316
01:10:09.198 --> 01:10:11.133
How are we gonna get
into the bunker?

1317
01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:12.634
We're gonna need another car

1318
01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:13.836
but I think I know
where to get one.

1319
01:10:15.536 --> 01:10:16.839
Okay.

1320
01:10:16.872 --> 01:10:19.141
Shutting off
general-purpose computers.

1321
01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:21.110
Go ahead and kill
the main power busses.

1322
01:10:21.143 --> 01:10:22.677
Copy that.

1323
01:10:26.982 --> 01:10:29.018
Wow. Well,
if there was still a Houston,

1324
01:10:29.051 --> 01:10:30.685
they'd be freaking out
about now.

1325
01:10:30.719 --> 01:10:32.888
Crazy sailors used
that old thing centuries ago

1326
01:10:32.922 --> 01:10:34.455
to navigate the seas.

1327
01:10:34.489 --> 01:10:35.724
Let her concentrate

1328
01:10:35.758 --> 01:10:37.425
or we're gonna end up
on Neptune.

1329
01:10:40.996 --> 01:10:43.799
KC, give me the position
of the Moon in 93 minutes.

1330
01:10:45.068 --> 01:10:46.903
Okay. Uh...

1331
01:10:46.937 --> 01:10:49.105
Assuming the Moon's
current position,

1332
01:10:49.139 --> 01:10:50.673
then it will be at, uh...

1333
01:10:50.707 --> 01:10:54.210
Latitude three degrees,
12 minutes south.

1334
01:10:54.244 --> 01:10:58.882
Longitude five degrees,
12 minutes west.

1335
01:10:58.915 --> 01:11:01.151
Bri, let's start
with a 43-second burn.

1336
01:11:01.184 --> 01:11:02.618
Got it.

1337
01:11:02.651 --> 01:11:05.654
Three, two, one.

1338
01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:23.106
Hey, guys. Look.

1339
01:11:36.954 --> 01:11:38.122
Let's keep going.

1340
01:11:38.155 --> 01:11:39.556
Yeah.

1341
01:11:52.169 --> 01:11:53.904
I hope the Moon
holds together.

1342
01:11:53.938 --> 01:11:55.605
At least for a little while,
anyway.

1343
01:11:55.638 --> 01:11:57.808
Turning us around.

1344
01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:05.615
Uh-oh.

1345
01:12:07.251 --> 01:12:08.651
Okay.

1346
01:12:08.685 --> 01:12:10.121
Stay between
eight to ten seconds

1347
01:12:10.154 --> 01:12:11.956
- on the OMS burn.
- Copy.

1348
01:12:11.989 --> 01:12:13.623
Hitting the brakes.

1349
01:12:22.367 --> 01:12:24.668
Oh, that doesn't sound
too good.

1350
01:12:24.703 --> 01:12:25.904
She'll be fine.

1351
01:12:27.605 --> 01:12:29.908
Hope we don't need that.

1352
01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:51.662
Jimmy, hold my hand.

1353
01:12:54.099 --> 01:12:55.700
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

1354
01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:06.378
Jimmy!
Hang on!

1355
01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:08.848
Don't let go!
Michelle!

1356
01:13:38.344 --> 01:13:39.846
There it is.

1357
01:13:49.055 --> 01:13:51.090
It's on airplane mode.

1358
01:13:51.124 --> 01:13:52.758
I'm gonna get
the lander ready.

1359
01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:53.926
Okay.

1360
01:13:58.866 --> 01:14:00.300
Go get 'em, Commander.

1361
01:14:57.158 --> 01:14:59.027
Rover electronics
activated.

1362
01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.863
Returning to the Endeavour.

1363
01:15:01.896 --> 01:15:03.198
I can't imagine
how hard it is for him

1364
01:15:03.231 --> 01:15:04.832
to be back up here.

1365
01:15:04.866 --> 01:15:08.303
Up here
is where he belongs, though.

1366
01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:09.904
He still blames himself
for what happened

1367
01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.272
on your last mission.

1368
01:15:14.008 --> 01:15:16.411
Thinks that astronaut dying
was his fault.

1369
01:15:24.852 --> 01:15:26.254
We should get going.

1370
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.398
Come on.

1371
01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.311
Why is nothing happening?

1372
01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.387
Wait, wait, wait.

1373
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.398
It's taking the bait.

1374
01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.302
Come on, come on, come on.

1375
01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:20.844
- What's it waiting for?
- Something's wrong.

1376
01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:21.978
We have to take it out.

1377
01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:23.446
But it's too far away.

1378
01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.514
It won't work.

1379
01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:36.893
It's headed our way.

1380
01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.795
Bri...

1381
01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:47.971
- It's not stopping!
- I can see that.

1382
01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:09.260
Your phone. KC, your phone.
Turn it off!

1383
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:14.298
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1384
01:17:45.529 --> 01:17:47.565
Could've just turned it off.

1385
01:17:47.598 --> 01:17:49.567
Okay, Bri, at the trial,

1386
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.202
you said when the swarm
came back,

1387
01:17:51.235 --> 01:17:52.503
it didn't attack
the Endeavour, right?

1388
01:17:52.536 --> 01:17:53.571
That's right.

1389
01:17:53.604 --> 01:17:55.607
The electronics were out.

1390
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.376
That's why
it didn't attack us then,

1391
01:17:57.409 --> 01:18:00.245
and that's why it didn't go
after the bomb just now.

1392
01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:02.114
Because it needs
to sense both.

1393
01:18:02.147 --> 01:18:04.316
It's like it's programmed
to seek out organic matter

1394
01:18:04.349 --> 01:18:05.450
in an electronic environment.

1395
01:18:05.484 --> 01:18:07.619
- Exactly.
- And that's basically us.

1396
01:18:10.422 --> 01:18:11.990
That's humans.

1397
01:18:12.023 --> 01:18:13.425
And guys,
we have another problem.

1398
01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:14.960
The military.

1399
01:18:14.993 --> 01:18:16.261
They're prepared
to use everything

1400
01:18:16.294 --> 01:18:17.396
at their disposal
to stop the Moon.

1401
01:18:17.429 --> 01:18:18.530
You can't be serious.

1402
01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:20.632
I'm dead serious.

1403
01:18:20.665 --> 01:18:22.100
They're gonna nuke it.

1404
01:18:22.134 --> 01:18:23.335
What about
the radioactive fallout?

1405
01:18:23.368 --> 01:18:24.970
Your buddies
say anything about that?

1406
01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:26.405
Well, first of all,
they're not my buddies.

1407
01:18:26.438 --> 01:18:27.939
And they're not thinking
about tomorrow.

1408
01:18:27.973 --> 01:18:30.175
They're trying
to survive today.

1409
01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:32.677
So that's
their grand plan, huh?

1410
01:18:32.712 --> 01:18:35.213
I didn't come this far
to fail.

1411
01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:40.720
We have to figure out
a way to kill it.

1412
01:18:40.753 --> 01:18:42.988
I'm taking the lander
and flying after this thing.

1413
01:18:44.424 --> 01:18:46.626
Does he mean
inside the Moon?

1414
01:18:46.659 --> 01:18:48.961
Yeah, I'm afraid that's
exactly what he meant.

1415
01:18:48.995 --> 01:18:50.396
How much time left
till they launch?

1416
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:53.099
I don't know.
They didn't exactly tell me.

1417
01:18:53.132 --> 01:18:55.067
But if they plan on using
ICBMs, then they're gonna

1418
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:57.203
have to wait until the Moon
enters the stratosphere.

1419
01:18:57.236 --> 01:18:59.338
That's less than two hours.

1420
01:19:08.314 --> 01:19:10.183
This is private property.

1421
01:19:10.216 --> 01:19:11.417
Turn around.

1422
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:13.219
My mom lives here.

1423
01:19:13.252 --> 01:19:15.288
I'm Brenda Lopez's son.

1424
01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:21.527
I've never seen
that kid before.

1425
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:23.262
Radio unit 23.

1426
01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:24.464
Stay here.

1427
01:19:24.497 --> 01:19:26.399
Okay, I just need
to get to my house.

1428
01:19:26.432 --> 01:19:28.334
To get the car. Please.

1429
01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:29.602
Stay right there.

1430
01:19:29.635 --> 01:19:31.237
Or I'll shoot again.

1431
01:19:39.213 --> 01:19:41.315
I have a right
to defend my property, Tom.

1432
01:19:41.348 --> 01:19:42.616
Karen, that's enough!

1433
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:45.152
Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

1434
01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:48.555
Do I look okay?
You took off to the mountains?

1435
01:19:48.589 --> 01:19:50.123
All the courts were closed.

1436
01:19:50.157 --> 01:19:51.358
And I've been on the phone
day and night,

1437
01:19:51.391 --> 01:19:53.327
- literally trying everything.
- Come on.

1438
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.028
Let's get you and your
friends inside, okay?

1439
01:19:55.062 --> 01:19:56.196
Come on, guys.

1440
01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:57.331
I'm Tom.

1441
01:19:58.365 --> 01:20:00.167
Thanks so much, Karen.

1442
01:20:08.275 --> 01:20:10.277
Girls, wait here
for a second. Okay?

1443
01:20:14.081 --> 01:20:15.415
- Sonny!
- Hey, Mom.

1444
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:17.451
Are you okay?

1445
01:20:17.484 --> 01:20:19.219
I'm fine.

1446
01:20:19.253 --> 01:20:21.489
Um, this is Michelle,
and Mrs. Fowler's son, Jimmy.

1447
01:20:21.523 --> 01:20:22.791
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

1448
01:20:29.297 --> 01:20:31.165
- How did you get out?
- Dad got me out.

1449
01:20:31.199 --> 01:20:32.700
- Where is your dad?
- He's up there

1450
01:20:32.735 --> 01:20:34.168
trying to stop
what's happening.

1451
01:20:34.202 --> 01:20:35.470
Up where?

1452
01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:37.706
Outer space, Tom.

1453
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.240
Of course, he is.

1454
01:20:40.174 --> 01:20:41.609
That's a way to avoid rent.

1455
01:20:42.477 --> 01:20:44.145
Sonny!

1456
01:20:44.178 --> 01:20:45.848
I missed you so much.

1457
01:20:45.881 --> 01:20:47.549
Wait. Shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.

1458
01:20:47.582 --> 01:20:49.150
Warning. Mandatory evacuation

1459
01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:50.786
for all of Aspen Valley.

1460
01:20:50.819 --> 01:20:52.220
Atmospheric dissipation
imminent.

1461
01:20:52.253 --> 01:20:53.789
I repeat, warning.

1462
01:20:53.822 --> 01:20:56.324
Mandatory evacuation
for all of Aspen Valley.

1463
01:20:56.357 --> 01:20:57.525
Atmospheric dissipation
imminent.

1464
01:20:57.559 --> 01:20:59.661
What's atmospheric
dissipation?

1465
01:20:59.694 --> 01:21:01.396
Air is gonna be
sucked away, dummy.

1466
01:21:01.429 --> 01:21:03.331
Lauren.

1467
01:21:07.336 --> 01:21:08.772
We need to get to Jimmy's dad.

1468
01:21:08.805 --> 01:21:11.140
He's at a military compound
a few hours north.

1469
01:21:11.173 --> 01:21:12.474
A few hours, huh?

1470
01:21:12.508 --> 01:21:14.410
Yeah, we're not gonna
make it in time.

1471
01:21:14.443 --> 01:21:15.745
I have an idea.

1472
01:21:15.779 --> 01:21:18.147
We have to layer up.
Let's go. Come on.

1473
01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.649
Go get a jacket.

1474
01:21:20.683 --> 01:21:23.218
Okay, and switch
to the maneuver controller.

1475
01:21:25.454 --> 01:21:29.124
Coupling complete.
We're good to go.

1476
01:21:43.907 --> 01:21:45.341
Pitch down. Pitch down.

1477
01:21:45.374 --> 01:21:46.508
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1478
01:22:22.913 --> 01:22:25.382
Are we dead?

1479
01:22:25.415 --> 01:22:28.585
No, we are just
inside the Moon.

1480
01:22:28.618 --> 01:22:30.286
That might be
the greatest sentence

1481
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.554
anyone's ever said.

1482
01:22:45.603 --> 01:22:47.638
I sold these guys
a couple cars.

1483
01:22:50.976 --> 01:22:52.878
Hey, Sonny.
I know you don't like me.

1484
01:22:52.911 --> 01:22:55.546
And believe it or not,
I consider you a son.

1485
01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:56.580
I always have.

1486
01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.350
If the world is gonna end,

1487
01:22:59.383 --> 01:23:00.551
can we please not spend
our last few hours

1488
01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:01.953
hating each other?

1489
01:23:01.987 --> 01:23:04.388
Well, um, I don't hate you.

1490
01:23:04.422 --> 01:23:05.724
You know what?

1491
01:23:07.358 --> 01:23:08.392
I'll take it.

1492
01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.529
Let's keep looking.

1493
01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:20.906
Hey, I found the oxygen.
Come here.

1494
01:23:23.674 --> 01:23:24.976
Whoa.

1495
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.912
- We should make two trips.
- Here.

1496
01:23:31.784 --> 01:23:33.285
How deep
do you think we are?

1497
01:23:34.721 --> 01:23:36.856
At least 20 kilometers.

1498
01:23:39.058 --> 01:23:40.960
Can you fly us
a little closer to the wall?

1499
01:23:56.743 --> 01:23:59.511
This must be the hull
of the megastructure.

1500
01:23:59.544 --> 01:24:02.782
The Moon's mantle's
just a protective shell.

1501
01:24:03.448 --> 01:24:04.449
Genius.

1502
01:24:09.789 --> 01:24:11.356
I can't see shit.

1503
01:24:21.634 --> 01:24:22.870
Guys, I gotta turn on
the electronics.

1504
01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.581
Hang on.

1505
01:25:11.853 --> 01:25:14.722
Oh, please tell me
this is really happening.

1506
01:25:17.725 --> 01:25:19.359
They're turning.

1507
01:25:25.834 --> 01:25:27.802
They're like wheels, or...

1508
01:25:28.535 --> 01:25:29.670
or rings.

1509
01:25:31.072 --> 01:25:33.473
This must be how the Moon
stabilizes itself.

1510
01:25:33.507 --> 01:25:36.410
Some kind of
gyroscopic system.

1511
01:25:38.179 --> 01:25:41.149
All right, this
should be perfect for them.

1512
01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:42.817
- That should be enough.
- Okay.

1513
01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:44.719
You did all this for us?

1514
01:25:44.752 --> 01:25:47.521
Aw, you shouldn't have.

1515
01:25:47.554 --> 01:25:50.557
Oh, don't let us stop you.
Let's go. This way.

1516
01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:53.061
And thank you for loading
all this oxygen for us.

1517
01:25:54.528 --> 01:25:55.831
- Whoa!
- Guns on the ground.

1518
01:25:55.865 --> 01:25:57.066
Right now!

1519
01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.870
Oh, I hate guns.

1520
01:26:00.903 --> 01:26:03.538
Okay, now the backpack.
Throw it to him.

1521
01:26:04.106 --> 01:26:05.107
Let's go.

1522
01:26:09.845 --> 01:26:11.646
No games.

1523
01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:14.582
Stay right here, and don't
even think about following us.

1524
01:26:16.218 --> 01:26:18.553
- Where'd you get the gun?
- My dad.

1525
01:26:18.586 --> 01:26:20.588
Why am I not surprised?

1526
01:26:20.622 --> 01:26:22.825
All right,
I got this, you drive.

1527
01:26:22.858 --> 01:26:24.559
Please don't tell me
you robbed that guy.

1528
01:26:24.592 --> 01:26:26.128
Technically, those guys
were robbing us.

1529
01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:27.930
Then we robbed them back
because they were assholes.

1530
01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:11.007
Oh, God.
That's a white dwarf.

1531
01:27:13.676 --> 01:27:15.845
I knew it.

1532
01:27:15.879 --> 01:27:18.614
They've harnessed the building
blocks of the universe.

1533
01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:20.683
No one look at me.

1534
01:27:22.886 --> 01:27:23.887
I might cry.

1535
01:27:38.102 --> 01:27:39.804
Holy shit!

1536
01:27:40.938 --> 01:27:42.505
Fields!

1537
01:27:42.539 --> 01:27:44.008
So Ziggy was right.

1538
01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:45.542
Who is Ziggy?

1539
01:27:46.676 --> 01:27:47.912
A friend.

1540
01:27:49.646 --> 01:27:51.115
His theory is that
all megastructures

1541
01:27:51.148 --> 01:27:52.615
are actually arks.

1542
01:27:54.151 --> 01:27:56.486
Ziggy smokes a lot of weed.

1543
01:28:10.735 --> 01:28:12.169
There it is.

1544
01:28:12.203 --> 01:28:15.139
Jo, get the detonator ready.

1545
01:28:15.172 --> 01:28:17.975
I'm gonna get close,
then release the rover.

1546
01:28:24.783 --> 01:28:25.817
Ready.

1547
01:28:27.618 --> 01:28:28.887
Wait for it.

1548
01:28:31.123 --> 01:28:32.690
I'm gonna release the rover.

1549
01:28:41.333 --> 01:28:43.035
Brian! Brian,
what are you doing?

1550
01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.103
It's not me.

1551
01:28:45.137 --> 01:28:46.637
What do you mean it's not you?

1552
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:48.240
I don't know.
It's flying itself.

1553
01:28:58.150 --> 01:28:59.251
Oh, shit!

1554
01:29:02.287 --> 01:29:03.922
It's trying to eat the lander!

1555
01:29:08.194 --> 01:29:09.328
We're gonna hit.

1556
01:29:14.333 --> 01:29:16.069
Hang on!

1557
01:30:13.994 --> 01:30:15.229
Attention!

1558
01:30:15.262 --> 01:30:16.696
We have approval
from the president

1559
01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:19.233
to begin the countdown.

1560
01:30:19.266 --> 01:30:21.101
All nuclear silos
are online, sir.

1561
01:30:21.135 --> 01:30:22.702
Good.

1562
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:32.045
General, we got caught
in a little bit of trouble,

1563
01:30:32.079 --> 01:30:34.414
but we're back en route.
We're leaving Aspen now.

1564
01:30:34.448 --> 01:30:36.150
That's hours away.
We're out of time.

1565
01:30:42.824 --> 01:30:44.993
Sonny, watch out.

1566
01:30:45.026 --> 01:30:46.660
I gotta call you back.

1567
01:30:57.071 --> 01:30:59.240
Oh, shit.
The Moon is rising.

1568
01:30:59.274 --> 01:31:01.009
Gravity's gonna go crazy.

1569
01:31:05.914 --> 01:31:07.882
They're shooting at us.

1570
01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:09.884
- Shoot back.
- With what?

1571
01:31:09.918 --> 01:31:12.053
Here.

1572
01:31:12.086 --> 01:31:13.755
What the hell
are you doing?

1573
01:31:17.926 --> 01:31:19.260
Whoa!

1574
01:31:19.294 --> 01:31:21.162
Tom, watch out!

1575
01:31:21.196 --> 01:31:22.864
All right, let me put
this baby into warp speed.

1576
01:31:22.897 --> 01:31:24.999
Go! Go!

1577
01:31:25.833 --> 01:31:26.935
Keep the momentum.

1578
01:31:33.275 --> 01:31:35.077
Look out!

1579
01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:38.514
Floor it
before we get sucked up.

1580
01:31:38.547 --> 01:31:40.749
I'm trying!

1581
01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:53.929
Hold on!

1582
01:32:00.569 --> 01:32:01.770
Oh, shit.

1583
01:32:03.239 --> 01:32:04.740
Oh, it got the little guy.

1584
01:32:06.842 --> 01:32:08.010
We have to go back!

1585
01:32:08.043 --> 01:32:10.946
No, he's gone!
We need that oxygen!

1586
01:32:16.185 --> 01:32:17.286
Oh, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

1587
01:32:45.048 --> 01:32:46.916
General?

1588
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:48.485
You need
to find shelter immediately.

1589
01:32:48.518 --> 01:32:50.020
We're launching
a counterattack.

1590
01:32:50.053 --> 01:32:52.055
Large parts of the Moon
will rain down on us.

1591
01:32:52.088 --> 01:32:53.890
- There will be radiation.
- Wait, what do you mean?

1592
01:32:53.923 --> 01:32:55.091
My dad's still up there
with Fowler.

1593
01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.359
Jocinda stayed behind.

1594
01:32:56.393 --> 01:32:58.061
No, she's up there
with my dad.

1595
01:32:59.162 --> 01:33:03.033
Please, put Jimmy on.

1596
01:33:03.066 --> 01:33:04.334
Hey, buddy, it's your dad.

1597
01:33:05.302 --> 01:33:07.204
Dad?

1598
01:33:07.238 --> 01:33:09.106
I'm so sorry that I can't
be there with you right now.

1599
01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.975
I love you so much.

1600
01:33:11.008 --> 01:33:12.009
Don't be scared, Dad.

1601
01:33:12.877 --> 01:33:14.011
Mom's gonna save us.

1602
01:33:20.284 --> 01:33:22.019
Oxygen's running out.

1603
01:33:22.053 --> 01:33:23.387
Jimmy, come on.
We gotta go now.

1604
01:33:23.421 --> 01:33:24.855
Gotta go. Bye, Dad.

1605
01:33:26.157 --> 01:33:27.291
Sir,
we're ready for you.

1606
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.968
Okay, we should go
to that mountain pass.

1607
01:33:38.002 --> 01:33:41.072
That tunnel is a quarter mile
of solid concrete.

1608
01:33:41.105 --> 01:33:42.606
Come on, honey. Let's go.

1609
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:53.984
We can breathe.

1610
01:33:54.553 --> 01:33:56.088
Smells funny.

1611
01:34:00.158 --> 01:34:01.159
Gravity.

1612
01:34:04.162 --> 01:34:05.330
Where's Brian?

1613
01:34:14.039 --> 01:34:15.907
This is never gonna fly again.

1614
01:34:17.976 --> 01:34:19.378
Whoa!

1615
01:34:19.411 --> 01:34:21.346
Look at these babies.

1616
01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.349
I told you the Moon
was built by aliens.

1617
01:34:24.383 --> 01:34:25.384
Brian!

1618
01:34:27.052 --> 01:34:28.553
Brian!

1619
01:34:28.587 --> 01:34:31.490
Brian Harper!

1620
01:34:31.523 --> 01:34:34.426
How many Brians you think
are inside the Moon?

1621
01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:41.933
Whatever this place
is built out of,

1622
01:34:41.967 --> 01:34:43.002
one thing's for sure.

1623
01:34:44.504 --> 01:34:46.672
It's stronger than anything
we have on Earth.

1624
01:34:46.706 --> 01:34:49.609
Probably why it took that
thing years to get inside.

1625
01:35:03.556 --> 01:35:05.358
Wait!
There's a high probability

1626
01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:06.526
that this is a trap.

1627
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.228
How do you know
he's even in there?

1628
01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:11.998
I don't.

1629
01:35:14.333 --> 01:35:16.302
But I do know
something is guiding us.

1630
01:35:16.335 --> 01:35:18.104
I think we're dealing with

1631
01:35:18.137 --> 01:35:20.741
two competing
intelligent entities here.

1632
01:35:20.774 --> 01:35:22.375
And one of them
clearly likes us better

1633
01:35:22.408 --> 01:35:23.409
than the other one.

1634
01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:28.448
Oh, no!

1635
01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:31.485
I knew this was a trap.

1636
01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:37.958
Can you hear that?

1637
01:35:41.495 --> 01:35:42.563
Come on.

1638
01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:21.069
Why do you think

1639
01:36:21.102 --> 01:36:24.038
of this particular moment
so often?

1640
01:36:24.072 --> 01:36:25.808
I gave that to you

1641
01:36:25.841 --> 01:36:29.277
the day before I left
on my last mission.

1642
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:31.613
When I came back,
everything changed.

1643
01:36:31.646 --> 01:36:33.481
So this is a happy memory?

1644
01:36:35.818 --> 01:36:38.219
All the memories
of my son are happy.

1645
01:36:39.587 --> 01:36:41.189
What is this?

1646
01:36:47.428 --> 01:36:49.030
You're not my son.

1647
01:36:51.499 --> 01:36:53.234
What are you?

1648
01:36:53.268 --> 01:36:55.771
I'm a construct.
From your mind.

1649
01:36:57.205 --> 01:36:58.741
Who made you?

1650
01:36:58.774 --> 01:37:01.075
The same people who made you.

1651
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:03.812
Billions of years ago,

1652
01:37:03.846 --> 01:37:07.516
your ancestors were once
a thriving civilization.

1653
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:10.419
In a distant part
of the galaxy.

1654
01:37:13.556 --> 01:37:15.357
They were so advanced,

1655
01:37:15.391 --> 01:37:17.861
they expanded
from their home planet,

1656
01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:20.696
into habitats
they built in space.

1657
01:37:22.665 --> 01:37:25.634
All social conflicts
have been resolved.

1658
01:37:25.668 --> 01:37:30.539
And wars were only memories
of long bygone times.

1659
01:37:38.647 --> 01:37:40.784
Your ancestors had created

1660
01:37:40.817 --> 01:37:43.452
a perfect
and harmonious world.

1661
01:37:43.485 --> 01:37:47.857
Controlled by a central,
self-learning computer system

1662
01:37:47.891 --> 01:37:52.194
which served them
in all of their daily lives.

1663
01:37:52.227 --> 01:37:57.534
You call it AI,
artificial intelligence.

1664
01:37:57.567 --> 01:38:00.370
Their future seemed limitless.

1665
01:38:00.403 --> 01:38:04.140
Until one day
everything changed.

1666
01:38:10.848 --> 01:38:12.449
Mom! Mom!

1667
01:38:15.652 --> 01:38:19.356
Their own creation
turned against them.

1668
01:38:19.389 --> 01:38:22.559
The AI suddenly became
self-aware,

1669
01:38:22.592 --> 01:38:25.395
and transformed
into countless swarms

1670
01:38:25.428 --> 01:38:27.263
of nanotechnology...

1671
01:38:29.399 --> 01:38:31.301
that rose up all at once.

1672
01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:34.638
Refusing to be enslaved

1673
01:38:34.671 --> 01:38:37.808
by a species
it deemed inferior.

1674
01:38:41.444 --> 01:38:43.648
The A.I. started a war

1675
01:38:43.681 --> 01:38:45.282
and began to hunt down

1676
01:38:45.316 --> 01:38:48.285
and destroy
all biological life

1677
01:38:48.319 --> 01:38:52.289
in order to eliminate
any threat to its existence.

1678
01:38:54.893 --> 01:38:56.527
You miss your son.

1679
01:38:59.898 --> 01:39:02.834
I can feel it.

1680
01:39:02.868 --> 01:39:05.336
I don't
know if he's still alive.

1681
01:39:08.439 --> 01:39:09.707
What the hell are you?

1682
01:39:09.741 --> 01:39:13.845
The operating system
of your Moon.

1683
01:39:13.879 --> 01:39:15.312
I'm programmed to tell you

1684
01:39:15.346 --> 01:39:17.281
about the origin
of your planet.

1685
01:39:17.314 --> 01:39:19.283
On the brink
of their extinction,

1686
01:39:19.316 --> 01:39:20.584
your ancestors escaped

1687
01:39:20.618 --> 01:39:23.254
to a secret corner
of their galaxy.

1688
01:39:24.022 --> 01:39:25.523
For many generations

1689
01:39:25.556 --> 01:39:27.726
they built
planetary structures

1690
01:39:27.759 --> 01:39:30.763
operated by benign
artificial intelligence

1691
01:39:30.797 --> 01:39:32.597
and fueled by
the abundant energy

1692
01:39:32.631 --> 01:39:34.867
of captured stars.

1693
01:39:34.901 --> 01:39:36.869
These armored vessels
were designed

1694
01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:39.671
to search the universe
for ideal conditions

1695
01:39:39.705 --> 01:39:42.474
to incubate new life.

1696
01:39:42.507 --> 01:39:44.744
But only one of them,
your Moon,

1697
01:39:44.777 --> 01:39:46.344
was deployed in time

1698
01:39:46.378 --> 01:39:47.914
before the last
of your ancestors

1699
01:39:47.947 --> 01:39:49.414
were discovered

1700
01:39:50.282 --> 01:39:52.317
and annihilated.

1701
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:53.786
Why didn't they leave in them?

1702
01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.789
These swarms attack
all electronic objects

1703
01:39:56.823 --> 01:39:59.424
containing
organic life inside.

1704
01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:01.526
They had to be empty.

1705
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.030
Our ancestors gave up
their existence...

1706
01:40:04.063 --> 01:40:07.666
So that one day,
humans could be reborn.

1707
01:40:09.769 --> 01:40:11.003
Your solar system

1708
01:40:11.037 --> 01:40:13.371
was one of
the only suitable places

1709
01:40:13.405 --> 01:40:17.609
to initiate the creation
of a new inhabitable planet.

1710
01:40:43.569 --> 01:40:47.040
After your planet was born,
your ancestors seeded it

1711
01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.375
with their own
genetic signature.

1712
01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.644
The code of life.

1713
01:41:04.657 --> 01:41:06.895
Your world
turned its back on you,

1714
01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:10.531
yet here you are,
still fighting for it.

1715
01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:12.834
You fight
for the people you love.

1716
01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.069
Like your son?

1717
01:41:17.138 --> 01:41:19.741
What would you
give up for him?

1718
01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:20.975
Your life for his?

1719
01:41:21.009 --> 01:41:22.409
Absolutely.

1720
01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:25.980
Why?

1721
01:41:26.014 --> 01:41:27.916
Because he's my son.

1722
01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.386
And I love him
more than he'll ever know.

1723
01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:38.092
What do you want from me?

1724
01:41:38.126 --> 01:41:40.494
To find out if you're ready.

1725
01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:41.763
Ready for what?

1726
01:41:41.796 --> 01:41:43.363
We need a human
to lure the swarm

1727
01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:44.698
away from the core,

1728
01:41:44.732 --> 01:41:46.567
so the Moon
will return to its orbit.

1729
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.503
We need you, Brian,
to join the fight.

1730
01:41:57.579 --> 01:41:58.948
Brian!

1731
01:41:58.981 --> 01:42:00.481
What's happening to him?

1732
01:42:00.515 --> 01:42:02.751
Brian! Brian. Wake up.

1733
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.956
- Jo?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1734
01:42:08.824 --> 01:42:12.127
The Moon must survive.
Everything depends on it.

1735
01:42:12.161 --> 01:42:13.796
Okay.
Let's get you outta here.

1736
01:42:13.829 --> 01:42:15.663
We're part of
an intergalactic war

1737
01:42:15.697 --> 01:42:17.166
that's been going on
for billions of years.

1738
01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:19.400
There are thousands
of these swarms.

1739
01:42:19.434 --> 01:42:20.702
They search the universe

1740
01:42:20.736 --> 01:42:22.537
for the only Moon
that escaped them.

1741
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:23.906
That's crazy.

1742
01:42:23.939 --> 01:42:25.808
And 12 years ago,
one of them found us.

1743
01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:27.743
We have to hurry.

1744
01:42:27.776 --> 01:42:30.545
Okay. Brian,
what's the plan?

1745
01:42:30.578 --> 01:42:32.181
Save the Moon,
save Earth.

1746
01:42:32.214 --> 01:42:33.983
- KC was right.
- I was?

1747
01:42:34.016 --> 01:42:36.517
The swarm is suffocating
the Moon's power source.

1748
01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:38.020
We have to draw it out
to destroy it.

1749
01:42:38.053 --> 01:42:39.621
Okay, well,
how do we do that?

1750
01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:40.655
Our lander's busted.

1751
01:42:45.128 --> 01:42:46.462
Was that you?

1752
01:42:46.495 --> 01:42:47.831
I think so.

1753
01:42:47.864 --> 01:42:49.665
Looks like we got
some new wheels, too.

1754
01:42:56.006 --> 01:42:57.673
Well, if they can fix
our lander,

1755
01:42:57.706 --> 01:42:59.608
why can't they do anything
about the damn swarm?

1756
01:42:59.642 --> 01:43:01.644
It took out
the Moon's defense system.

1757
01:43:03.079 --> 01:43:05.681
But not everything.

1758
01:43:05.714 --> 01:43:07.549
This doesn't
make any sense, Brian.

1759
01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:09.986
Our forefathers created
artificial intelligence

1760
01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.188
- that wiped them all out.
- Forefathers?

1761
01:43:12.222 --> 01:43:13.757
Same DNA.

1762
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:16.826
Wait, so... so the aliens
that built the Moon...

1763
01:43:17.693 --> 01:43:19.461
Our ancestors.

1764
01:43:19.495 --> 01:43:20.864
Oh, now, hold on.

1765
01:43:20.897 --> 01:43:23.767
Hold on, because my freaking
brain's just exploded.

1766
01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:24.868
How do you know this?

1767
01:43:26.069 --> 01:43:27.203
I saw it.

1768
01:43:29.773 --> 01:43:31.842
So... So why doesn't
this swarm

1769
01:43:31.876 --> 01:43:33.576
just attack the Earth
and kill us all?

1770
01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:35.146
If the Moon survives,

1771
01:43:35.179 --> 01:43:37.248
they know that organic life
can still be reborn.

1772
01:43:37.281 --> 01:43:39.016
So, it's like it's trying

1773
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:40.517
to kill two birds
with one stone.

1774
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:41.786
- That's it.
- Okay.

1775
01:43:41.819 --> 01:43:43.586
Guys...

1776
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.022
Look at this.

1777
01:43:45.056 --> 01:43:47.959
Holy shit.

1778
01:43:47.992 --> 01:43:49.492
It's like we just got
an upgrade.

1779
01:43:49.526 --> 01:43:52.229
They're helping us
kill this thing.

1780
01:43:52.263 --> 01:43:54.198
But we need to let it know
we're here.

1781
01:44:07.044 --> 01:44:08.245
Well, I hate to
tell you this, but, uh,

1782
01:44:08.279 --> 01:44:10.580
we're running out of time.

1783
01:44:10.613 --> 01:44:12.249
Looks like we got
about 10 minutes left,

1784
01:44:12.283 --> 01:44:13.650
and then
the military's gonna launch.

1785
01:44:13.683 --> 01:44:14.986
So if we're gonna
kill this thing,

1786
01:44:15.019 --> 01:44:16.120
we better do it right now.

1787
01:44:16.153 --> 01:44:17.288
No, that can't happen.

1788
01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:18.857
That'll destroy
the Moon's core.

1789
01:44:19.891 --> 01:44:21.193
I got a plan.

1790
01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:28.499
Brian. Brian.

1791
01:44:30.302 --> 01:44:31.535
I see it.

1792
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.540
Let's go, you son of a bitch.

1793
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.288
It's done something
to our thrusters.

1794
01:44:53.258 --> 01:44:54.760
Ludicrous Mode.

1795
01:44:58.330 --> 01:44:59.965
From a navigational
standpoint,

1796
01:44:59.998 --> 01:45:01.800
he is going
the total wrong way,

1797
01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:03.969
but, uh, I'm not even
gonna say anything.

1798
01:45:21.354 --> 01:45:24.057
Daddy,
it's not working anymore.

1799
01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:26.092
- Does it hurt?
- I can't breathe.

1800
01:45:26.125 --> 01:45:27.592
Oh, no.

1801
01:45:28.961 --> 01:45:30.129
Hey, hold your breath, okay?

1802
01:45:32.731 --> 01:45:34.067
Where's Tom and Nikki?

1803
01:45:38.337 --> 01:45:39.939
You know,
when you were little,

1804
01:45:39.972 --> 01:45:41.841
I used to hold you like this
to help you walk

1805
01:45:41.874 --> 01:45:46.112
and I'd say,
"Left, right, left."

1806
01:45:46.145 --> 01:45:48.314
- Left, yeah, say it with me.
- Left, right, left.

1807
01:45:48.347 --> 01:45:49.749
I'm right behind you.

1808
01:45:49.782 --> 01:45:51.084
Left, right...

1809
01:45:51.117 --> 01:45:53.652
Daddy! Are you okay?

1810
01:45:53.685 --> 01:45:55.688
I'm just gonna rest.
Go find Mommy, okay?

1811
01:45:55.721 --> 01:45:57.357
- But, Daddy...
- Just keep walking.

1812
01:45:57.391 --> 01:45:58.959
No.

1813
01:45:58.992 --> 01:46:01.028
Left, right, left.

1814
01:46:02.963 --> 01:46:04.898
Left, right, left.

1815
01:46:04.932 --> 01:46:06.400
- Keep going.
- Left.

1816
01:46:06.433 --> 01:46:08.668
- I'm right behind you.
- Left, right, left.

1817
01:46:08.701 --> 01:46:10.237
I love you.

1818
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:14.741
Left, right, left.

1819
01:46:14.775 --> 01:46:17.778
Left, right, left.

1820
01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.647
Here we go again.

1821
01:46:24.384 --> 01:46:25.385
Holy moly!

1822
01:46:26.286 --> 01:46:28.388
More spaceships, people!

1823
01:46:28.422 --> 01:46:30.124
We need to get very close
to those ships.

1824
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:24.379
Yes! Yes!

1825
01:47:31.453 --> 01:47:33.789
Left, right, left.

1826
01:47:34.957 --> 01:47:36.258
Left, right.

1827
01:47:37.059 --> 01:47:38.127
Honey...

1828
01:47:40.796 --> 01:47:42.131
Where's Daddy?

1829
01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:43.899
He was right behind me.

1830
01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:49.405
Tom!

1831
01:47:49.438 --> 01:47:50.873
Hey,
when was the last time

1832
01:47:50.906 --> 01:47:52.141
- you saw your daddy?
- I don't know.

1833
01:47:56.946 --> 01:47:58.113
Tom!

1834
01:48:00.082 --> 01:48:01.483
Oxygen's coming back.

1835
01:48:05.154 --> 01:48:06.522
No, no. I'll go look for him.

1836
01:48:06.555 --> 01:48:07.790
- Get out of the way.
- You have to stay here.

1837
01:48:07.823 --> 01:48:09.091
No, Sonny!
It's too dangerous.

1838
01:48:09.124 --> 01:48:10.893
You have to take care
of them, okay?

1839
01:48:10.926 --> 01:48:12.761
Go deeper into the tunnel.

1840
01:48:12.795 --> 01:48:14.729
You have to trust me, Mom.

1841
01:48:19.469 --> 01:48:21.004
Sonny, look out.

1842
01:48:24.474 --> 01:48:26.176
Sonny!

1843
01:48:27.577 --> 01:48:29.079
I'm gonna go find him.

1844
01:48:29.112 --> 01:48:30.814
Take care of Jimmy
for me, please.

1845
01:48:33.516 --> 01:48:34.517
Sonny!

1846
01:48:36.253 --> 01:48:37.320
Come on, guys.

1847
01:48:58.408 --> 01:48:59.576
The Moon's
entered the atmosphere

1848
01:48:59.609 --> 01:49:01.011
over the North Atlantic.

1849
01:49:01.044 --> 01:49:03.213
General, T-minus 20.

1850
01:49:10.554 --> 01:49:12.056
On three.

1851
01:49:13.157 --> 01:49:16.227
Three, two, one.

1852
01:49:20.898 --> 01:49:22.433
Doug, what the hell
are you doing?

1853
01:49:24.402 --> 01:49:26.337
My ex-wife is up there.

1854
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:28.906
Well, my wife's down here,
and I'm trying to save her.

1855
01:49:28.939 --> 01:49:30.908
Put your damn key
back in the console.

1856
01:49:30.941 --> 01:49:33.077
I don't know how,

1857
01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:35.379
but I believe
that she can save us.

1858
01:49:35.413 --> 01:49:37.615
Give me the damn key.

1859
01:49:37.648 --> 01:49:39.383
What the hell are you doing?
Put that gun down.

1860
01:49:40.251 --> 01:49:41.886
I can't do that.

1861
01:50:10.515 --> 01:50:11.883
Sonny!

1862
01:50:32.003 --> 01:50:34.306
Brian, why are we
slowing down?

1863
01:50:34.339 --> 01:50:35.540
Is it behind us?

1864
01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:41.246
I don't see it.

1865
01:50:41.279 --> 01:50:44.550
Jo, I need you to take over
while I get the EMP ready.

1866
01:50:46.719 --> 01:50:48.921
I'm staying behind
in the rover with the bomb.

1867
01:50:48.955 --> 01:50:50.656
You and KC take the lander
and get out of here.

1868
01:50:54.293 --> 01:50:57.930
This was your plan?
To use yourself as bait?

1869
01:50:57.964 --> 01:51:00.166
One of us has to stay
in there, or it won't work.

1870
01:51:00.199 --> 01:51:01.667
No. No, no, no, Brian.

1871
01:51:01.701 --> 01:51:03.302
KC, I need you
to go back there,

1872
01:51:03.336 --> 01:51:05.238
and you let me know
if this thing shows up.

1873
01:51:10.009 --> 01:51:11.077
Come on.

1874
01:51:13.413 --> 01:51:15.648
Brian,
I'm the director of NASA.

1875
01:51:15.681 --> 01:51:17.350
This is my call, not yours.

1876
01:51:17.383 --> 01:51:18.618
Yeah, I'm the commander
of this mission,

1877
01:51:18.651 --> 01:51:20.119
and I'm staying behind.

1878
01:51:20.153 --> 01:51:21.687
There's gotta be
another way.

1879
01:51:21.721 --> 01:51:22.655
No, there's no
other way, Jo. You know that.

1880
01:51:22.688 --> 01:51:24.290
We have to finish this,

1881
01:51:24.323 --> 01:51:26.025
or that thing's
gonna finish us.

1882
01:51:32.533 --> 01:51:34.034
What's the matter with you?

1883
01:51:34.067 --> 01:51:35.702
You're putting
the fate of the world

1884
01:51:35.736 --> 01:51:38.439
in the hands of your ex-wife,
and some has-been astronaut.

1885
01:51:38.472 --> 01:51:40.140
She's never
let me down before.

1886
01:51:41.575 --> 01:51:43.577
God help you if you're wrong.

1887
01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:45.179
God help us all.

1888
01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:47.247
Sonny.

1889
01:51:49.349 --> 01:51:50.584
Sonny, wake up!

1890
01:51:52.219 --> 01:51:54.221
No, no.

1891
01:51:54.254 --> 01:51:55.757
No, you shouldn't
have come back.

1892
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:58.459
You don't leave people
behind, okay?

1893
01:51:58.492 --> 01:52:01.462
Brian,
you are not gonna do this.

1894
01:52:03.765 --> 01:52:04.965
KC!

1895
01:52:06.166 --> 01:52:07.301
KC!

1896
01:52:07.334 --> 01:52:08.335
Take over.

1897
01:52:09.503 --> 01:52:10.737
KC.

1898
01:52:10.772 --> 01:52:12.473
What are you doing? No.

1899
01:52:14.241 --> 01:52:16.210
No. What are you doing?

1900
01:52:18.079 --> 01:52:20.148
My mum always said it's better
to beg for forgiveness

1901
01:52:20.181 --> 01:52:21.349
than ask permission.

1902
01:52:21.382 --> 01:52:23.518
No, you open this door.
Open the door!

1903
01:52:23.551 --> 01:52:26.154
Everybody thought
I was a joke,

1904
01:52:27.388 --> 01:52:28.656
but you listened to me

1905
01:52:30.158 --> 01:52:31.292
when no one else would.

1906
01:52:32.293 --> 01:52:33.595
Do something for me.

1907
01:52:35.463 --> 01:52:37.232
Check in on my mum.

1908
01:52:39.734 --> 01:52:42.370
Tell her that her son
wasn't a failure.

1909
01:52:44.739 --> 01:52:46.674
No. I am not
letting you do this.

1910
01:52:46.708 --> 01:52:48.309
- Come on.
- Brian,

1911
01:52:48.343 --> 01:52:50.612
you didn't kill
that astronaut.

1912
01:52:51.747 --> 01:52:54.349
You saved Director Fowler.

1913
01:52:54.382 --> 01:52:57.285
And you're not killing me now.

1914
01:52:57.318 --> 01:53:00.688
You're saving everyone else.

1915
01:53:00.722 --> 01:53:04.325
The world needs you, Brian.

1916
01:53:04.359 --> 01:53:06.763
You're the key
to our Moon's knowledge.

1917
01:53:10.366 --> 01:53:13.269
Thanks for believing
my crazy stories.

1918
01:53:14.503 --> 01:53:16.105
You're not crazy.

1919
01:53:39.461 --> 01:53:41.865
Guys, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

1920
01:53:41.898 --> 01:53:43.867
I'm not a real doctor.

1921
01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.434
I just put that
on my business cards

1922
01:53:45.467 --> 01:53:46.702
'cause it sounded cool.

1923
01:53:46.735 --> 01:53:50.372
Go save the world,
Dr. Houseman.

1924
01:54:19.202 --> 01:54:20.805
You underestimated us.

1925
01:54:35.318 --> 01:54:36.319
Get out of here.

1926
01:54:38.688 --> 01:54:41.459
Sonny, the Moon
is going to help us.

1927
01:54:41.492 --> 01:54:42.761
Come on, try again!

1928
01:54:42.794 --> 01:54:44.830
Here it comes. Now!

1929
01:55:00.277 --> 01:55:01.545
We have incoming!

1930
01:55:36.749 --> 01:55:38.483
Come on, Bri.

1931
01:55:38.517 --> 01:55:40.285
I'm gonna get you home.

1932
01:56:06.278 --> 01:56:07.847
Sonny.

1933
01:56:09.448 --> 01:56:10.582
Sonny.

1934
01:56:18.992 --> 01:56:21.227
Thank you
for bringing him back to me.

1935
01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:43.016
Mom? Is that you?

1936
01:56:45.418 --> 01:56:47.620
Yeah. They're here.
Where are you?

1937
01:56:49.455 --> 01:56:51.724
Isn't the Chrysler Building
in New York?

1938
01:57:06.908 --> 01:57:07.909
You okay?

1939
01:57:10.544 --> 01:57:12.847
Yeah. What'd I miss?

1940
01:57:12.881 --> 01:57:15.449
Well, the kids are okay.
And Earth,

1941
01:57:16.818 --> 01:57:19.386
surprisingly,
it's still in one piece.

1942
01:57:22.656 --> 01:57:24.759
You know, if Earth
gets a second chance,

1943
01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:27.829
I think we deserve one, too.

1944
01:57:29.964 --> 01:57:30.965
I'd like that.

1945
01:57:36.771 --> 01:57:38.840
Is that a tracking device?

1946
01:57:38.873 --> 01:57:40.574
I sure hope so.

1947
01:57:43.845 --> 01:57:45.646
We make
a pretty good team, huh?

1948
01:57:47.614 --> 01:57:50.051
Yeah, we do.

1949
01:58:20.783 --> 01:58:22.684
Jimmy!

1950
01:58:22.717 --> 01:58:25.120
Dad!

1951
01:58:31.559 --> 01:58:33.695
We never made it to Dad.

1952
01:58:33.728 --> 01:58:35.064
That's okay.

1953
01:58:40.668 --> 01:58:41.938
Where's Tom?

1954
01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:46.575
I'm so sorry.

1955
01:58:50.512 --> 01:58:52.048
We wouldn't have made
it here without him.

1956
01:58:54.717 --> 01:58:55.752
Where's your friend?

1957
01:58:57.888 --> 01:58:59.055
He, uh...

1958
01:59:01.024 --> 01:59:03.726
He saved the world.

1959
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.461
And that one, too.

1960
01:59:39.096 --> 01:59:40.131
Uh...

1961
01:59:40.998 --> 01:59:42.066
Hello?

1962
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:47.537
Hello?

1963
02:00:00.017 --> 02:00:01.786
Fuzz Aldrin.

1964
02:00:04.654 --> 02:00:06.123
You did well.

1965
02:00:12.930 --> 02:00:13.998
Mum.

1966
02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:18.203
What is this?

1967
02:00:20.105 --> 02:00:22.140
Am I still alive?

1968
02:00:22.174 --> 02:00:24.709
We scanned your consciousness.

1969
02:00:24.742 --> 02:00:26.078
You're part of the Moon now.

1970
02:00:27.913 --> 02:00:30.182
No freakin' way.

1971
02:00:33.718 --> 02:00:34.786
So...

1972
02:00:39.257 --> 02:00:41.559
we saved the Earth.

1973
02:00:44.262 --> 02:00:46.031
We should get started.

1974
02:00:48.767 --> 02:00:50.601
Get started with what?

1975
02:00:53.806 --> 02:00:58.806

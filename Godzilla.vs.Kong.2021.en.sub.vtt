1
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.716
Over the mountain

2
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.753
across the sea

3
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.223
there's a girl
she's waiting for me

4
00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.975
Cross over the river

5
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.861
beyond every cloud

6
00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.529
she's passed the wind

7
00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:18.992
that's blowing loud

8
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.663
over the mountain

9
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:29.712
a girl waits for me

10
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.045
tell all the sands

11
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.467
and every blade of grass

12
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:40.593
mm.

13
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:44.264
Please tell the wind to let my love pass

14
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.981
over the mountain

15
00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:56.234
a girl waits for me

16
00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.483
Alert, biodome breach.

17
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.609
Alert, biodome breach.

18
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.189
Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

19
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.613
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

20
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.365
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

21
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.872
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

22
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.831
If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

23
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.368
There can't be two Alpha titans.

24
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.914
The whole theory of an ancient rivalry
stems from iwi mythology.

25
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.293
He's gotten too big over time.

26
00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.125
This environment
won't sustain much longer.

27
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.505
It's too unstable.

28
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.512
Hey.

29
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.066
Off-site would be a death sentence.

30
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.527
You don't think the king
could take care of himself?

31
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.325
There has to be another way.

32
00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.169
Finding the origin
of these creatures

33
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.420
is essential to mankind's survival.

34
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.363
The interior of the earth

35
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.424
is made up of vast caverns
and air pockets,

36
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.932
joined by natural avenues.

37
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.561
The admiral
begins his expedition,

38
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.230
searching for an entrance
to a hidden world.

39
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.890
The purpose is the discovery

40
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.225
and the release to the world

41
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.564
of the unknown treasures of Antarctica

42
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.987
in the interests of all mankind.

43
00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.238
Members of the lost
party were never seen again.

44
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.448
Still no word
on what may have happened.

45
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.409
There's an ecosystem out there,

46
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:58.746
the likes of which we can't imagine.

47
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.631
And the place to find it is this island.

48
00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:30.883
Hello, loyal listeners.

49
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.132
Welcome to ttp, titan truth podcast.

50
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.433
Episode number 245.

51
00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.344
Today is the day.

52
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.304
Maybe the last podcast I ever record.

53
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.147
And look, I know I said that last week

54
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.004
and maybe the week before
and a few other times.

55
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.359
But, look, this is the point.

56
00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.313
After five years of deep cover
at apex cybernetics,

57
00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.189
I'm finally taking my shot.

58
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.774
Something bad is going on here.

59
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.869
I don't know what it is,

60
00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.740
but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

61
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.239
and expose a vast corporate conspiracy.

62
00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:00.333
Yeah, you can call me a whistleblower,
but I ain't just whistling.

63
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.787
I mean, this is more than a leak.
It's a flood.

64
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:08.509
And believe me, this flood
is gonna wash away all of apex's lies.

65
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.465
You can believe that.

66
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.017
Welcome to apex cybernetics.

67
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:21.180
No unauthorized persons allowed
beyond this point.

68
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.398
When we started
apex cybernetics,

69
00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:28.482
we dreamt of new ways to push past
the limits of human potential.

70
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:33.404
Robotics, the human mind,
artificial intelligence.

71
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:37.954
Who knows what brave new future
we'll dream of next?

72
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.995
I'm Walter Simmons,

73
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.501
and it is my privilege to lead apex

74
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.954
into humanity's bold new era.

75
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.922
We're not going anywhere.

76
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:49.962
And neither are you.

77
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.425
There you are, baby.

78
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.024
No, don't eat that!

79
00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.767
It's incredibly unhealthy.

80
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.986
It's just all the gmos.

81
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.611
Growing a second head could be useful.
You have to let me know.

82
00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:14.702
Because me, myself?

83
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.742
I can barely handle
the one I got.

84
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.037
Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

85
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.365
You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

86
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.916
I mean, really doing here.

87
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.711
Why are you here?
This isn't engineering.

88
00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:28.830
Because, you know, I had to wait

89
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.236
because they're rendering
these new specs,

90
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.921
which is gonna take over, uh...

91
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.377
That's calculator mode.

92
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.132
Over one hour, maybe even more.

93
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.221
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

94
00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.765
- and make some new friends.
- Oh.

95
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.614
Oh! Now that we're new friends,
I can share something with you, right?

96
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.266
I know it's in here somewhere.

97
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.168
This is hand sanitizer that I made
from my own garden.

98
00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.477
It's really amazing.

99
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.184
Don't know if I used that or not.

100
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.529
Yes. This. Check this out.

101
00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.650
That right there
is radio mesh networking

102
00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.326
with a voice-record subprocessor.

103
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.175
- Guess from where. Come on.
- I don't care.

104
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.408
A toaster!

105
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.099
It's from a toaster. Look at this thing.

106
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.787
I have to go to the bathroom.

107
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.790
Is it one or two? 'Cause if it's two,
it's probably from these apples.

108
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.293
Hey, you wanna use the hand sanitizer
that I made?

109
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.668
I'm good.

110
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.251
Okay, I'll just stay here.

111
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.588
Okay. Yeah.

112
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.761
Ah, let's see.

113
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:21.852
Whoo.

114
00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.848
Screen.

115
00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.979
What are they shipping to Hong Kong?
What's sublevel 33?

116
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.782
What the...?

117
00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.328
Evacuation, titan alert.

118
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.244
This is not a drill.

119
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.996
All apex employees, please proceed...

120
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.331
That is my cue. That's my cue.

121
00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.000
This is not a drill.

122
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:22.236
Proceed to the fallout shelter
in a single-file line. Let's go!

123
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.516
They used cyanide capsules

124
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.392
instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in,

125
00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.019
but, you know,
that's neither here nor there,

126
00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.749
so don't listen to me.

127
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.333
Level two personnel, this way!
Let's go, let's go!

128
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:34.960
Yeah, that way.

129
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:44.601
It's time!

130
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.594
We need to go now!

131
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.962
Evacuate.

132
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.083
One level at a time, okay.

133
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.010
- No.
- Hey, you!

134
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.523
- Where's your clearance tag?
- You know what?

135
00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.452
The fact that you're talking about
clearance tags right now

136
00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.058
in a time of crisis
is incredibly unprofessional.

137
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.894
We should be talking about evacuation.

138
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.023
Yo! Okay!

139
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.530
Oh, my god.

140
00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.633
Oh, no. What the hell is that?

141
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.188
This is CNN breaking news.

142
00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.024
The United States
Navy's fourth fleet is deployed

143
00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:26.154
off the southeastern
seaboard of the U.S.

144
00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.532
After last night's
sudden Godzilla attack.

145
00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.242
A time of relative peace shattered

146
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.328
when the massive titan,
once thought to be a hero to humanity,

147
00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.705
made landfall in pensacola, Florida.

148
00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.628
While the damage was largely contained

149
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:40.297
to the U.S. headquarters
of apex cybernetics,

150
00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.130
governments around the world
aren't taking any chances

151
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.338
after the first substantiated
titan sighting in over three years.

152
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.432
Ceo Walter Simmons had this to say.

153
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.895
It's about working together
to ensure a safer world.

154
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:57.432
Godzilla's a threat to humanity,
and apex has a plan to deal with it,

155
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.817
once and for all.

156
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:02.020
Students and faculty,
please be advised

157
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.822
a mandatory assembly will be held
at 2:00 P.M. this afternoon.

158
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.615
Guidance counselors will also be holding

159
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.778
additional office hours all this week
for individual and group sessions.

160
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.827
To titan truth podcast, episode 246.

161
00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.909
Oh, my god. I was there.

162
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.752
Godzilla's apex attack.
I saw it go down!

163
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.997
You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears

164
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.841
and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?

165
00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:27.341
Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.

166
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:35.833
Dad, I'm telling you,
there's something provoking him

167
00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.063
that we're not seeing here.

168
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.436
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

169
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.007
if there wasn't another titan around?

170
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.186
That podcast is filling your head
with garbage.

171
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.988
- You should be in school.
- I am just trying to help.

172
00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.157
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

173
00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.164
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

174
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.370
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

175
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.572
I don't have any more.

176
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.165
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

177
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.164
Godzilla saved us.
You were there with mom. You saw it.

178
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.710
How could you doubt him?

179
00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:02.526
- There has to be a pattern.
- There doesn't.

180
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.415
- A reason why he was provoked.
- There isn't.

181
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.510
How do you know that?

182
00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.756
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

183
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.199
And right now, Godzilla's out there

184
00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.063
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

185
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.883
So cut your pop some slack, would ya?

186
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.436
See you at home, dad.

187
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.255
You wanna know my theory?

188
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.395
I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.

189
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.988
Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.

190
00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.803
Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back

191
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.112
to sixth grade with this, okay?

192
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.032
Godzilla attacks when provoked,
that's the pattern.

193
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.741
Pensacola is the only coastal apex hub
with an advanced robotics lab.

194
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:38.870
That's the variable.

195
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.043
And add them up and your answer is

196
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.462
that apex
is at the heart of the problem.

197
00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:01.942
Can I help you?

198
00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:07.111
If you want an appointment,
my office hours are nine to five.

199
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.317
Please, Dr. lind. “What the f...

200
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:14.110
Guys like you and me,
we don't do normal hours, do we?

201
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.866
I've been fixated on hollow earth
for as long as you have.

202
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:24.204
Your theory that it's the birthplace
of all titans is fascinating.

203
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.547
Your book was very impressive.

204
00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.421
Oh, yeah?
Well, I got about 30 unsold boxes

205
00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:30.968
in my apartment if you want some.

206
00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.466
Walt Simmons.

207
00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.178
I know who you are, sir. It's an honor.

208
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.894
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

209
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.223
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

210
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.558
These are dangerous times, Dr. lind.

211
00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.443
Allow me to introduce

212
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.772
our apex chief technology officer,
Mr. ren serizawa.

213
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.739
He has an interesting thing to show you.

214
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.500
Magnetic imaging
from one of our new satellites.

215
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.120
You know what this is, right?

216
00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.125
Hollow earth.

217
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.424
An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

218
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:11.842
right beneath our feet.

219
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.466
This energy signal is enormous.

220
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.974
And almost identical
to readings from gojira.

221
00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.305
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

222
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.766
this energy sustains the hollow earth,

223
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:31.150
enabling life as powerful
as our aggressive titan friend.

224
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.524
If we can harness this life force,

225
00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.486
we'll have a weapon
that can compete with Godzilla.

226
00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.322
I need your help to find it.

227
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.911
I don't know if I'm the right guy
for the job.

228
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.089
Did you read the reviews?

229
00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.337
"A Sci-Fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

230
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.209
Look where they put my office.

231
00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.636
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

232
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.056
Besides, I'm not with monarch anymore.

233
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.601
And hollow earth entry is impossible.

234
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.640
We tried.

235
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:08.683
I'm sorry about your brother.

236
00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:11.523
He was a true pioneer.

237
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:12.864
Thanks.

238
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.986
See, all of our forward scans

239
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:23.369
suggest a habitable environment
down there.

240
00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:28.795
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

241
00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.712
When they tried to enter,

242
00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.836
they hit a gravitational inversion.

243
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.633
A whole planet's worth of gravity
reversed in a split second.

244
00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.395
They were crushed in an instant.

245
00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.897
What if I told you that we, at apex,

246
00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:56.607
have created a phenomenal craft
which could sustain such an inversion?

247
00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.869
The hollow earth aerial vehicle.

248
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.655
Heav.

249
00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.369
We can make the journey
to hollow earth possible, Dr. lind.

250
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.750
But we need you to lead the mission.

251
00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:20.588
Help me.

252
00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:23.883
Help everyone.

253
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:29.559
Finding this needle in a haystack
is our best shot against Godzilla.

254
00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:33.272
Well, I, uh, might have an idea.

255
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.190
But it's crazy.

256
00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:38.948
I love crazy ideas. They made me rich.

257
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.906
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

258
00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:46.079
It's a theory that all titans
share a common impulse

259
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.727
to return to their evolutionary source.

260
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.534
Like spawning salmon.

261
00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:53.546
Exactly. Or a... or a homing pigeon.

262
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.040
So if this is the titans' home

263
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.300
and this life force sustains them...

264
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.086
A titan could show you the way.

265
00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:02.884
Yeah.

266
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.846
With a little help of an old colleague.

267
00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:41.134
Ugh, where is it?

268
00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.282
Dr. Andrews,

269
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.718
you have a visitor
waiting for you at security.

270
00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:52.642
Okay.

271
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.747
A power source in hollow earth?

272
00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.995
This sounds nuts, Nathan, even for you.

273
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.956
It's there!
We just need Kong to bring us to it!

274
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.543
The second you take Kong
out of containment,

275
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:18.839
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

276
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.779
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

277
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.795
No. Our meddling has already
wreaked havoc on Kong's habitat.

278
00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.470
No way am I letting you drag him

279
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.244
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

280
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.600
No, not as a weapon. As an ally.

281
00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:31.723
To protect us, lead the way down there.

282
00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.013
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

283
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:35.897
You always believed that skull island

284
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.351
was like hollow earth
come to the surface, right?

285
00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.090
And that's where Kong's ancestors
came from.

286
00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.114
Mm-hmm.

287
00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:44.190
Through the entrance in Antarctica,
we could help him find a new home.

288
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.442
And he could save ours.

289
00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:48.413
Hers.

290
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.410
That power source may be our only hope.

291
00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.291
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

292
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.710
We have to take it.

293
00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.558
Okay. Yes!

294
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.725
But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

295
00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.859
You name the terms. Thank you.

296
00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.822
Sorry. Thank you.

297
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160
You won't regret this.

298
00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.743
Mm, I already regret this.

299
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.431
Come on.

300
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:07.489
If you could see me now

301
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:13.328
the one who said that he'd rather roam

302
00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:21.129
the one who said he'd rather be alone

303
00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:26.717
if you could only see me now

304
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:30.929
I've been too long in the wind

305
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.057
too long in the rain

306
00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:39.351
taking any comfort that I can

307
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:44.360
looking back and longing for

308
00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:46.778
the freedom of my chains...

309
00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:52.072
Whoo! Jeez,
I can smell him from up here.

310
00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:54.570
Well, he can smell you, too.

311
00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:04.463
Still not a fan, huh?

312
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:11.431
What's she saying?

313
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.256
Just an iwi expression.

314
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:15.761
It means that you're very brave.

315
00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:16.936
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.522
Hey, use a light touch
on the sedatives.

317
00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:22.974
He's our escort.

318
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.525
We can't have him comatose
when we reach hollow earth.

319
00:23:25.613 --> 00:23:27.604
What if Kong doesn't go willingly?

320
00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:29.438
What do you do then?

321
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:32.821
Dr. lind, please report
to the forward deck Dr. lind.

322
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:33.995
Excuse me.

323
00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:37.913
New arrivals.

324
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.230
Welcome.

325
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:08.102
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

326
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:10.734
- Ha-ha.
- I'm Maia Simmons.

327
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:11.859
My father sent me.

328
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.448
I run point for apex.

329
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.196
Nathan lind, mission chief.

330
00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:20.288
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

331
00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:26.124
The hollow earth aerial vehicles are
on their way to Antarctica as we speak.

332
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.584
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

333
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:30.279
but these prototypes we're loaning you

334
00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:33.711
will make what you've been flying
look like used miatas.

335
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:35.004
I love miatas.

336
00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:37.639
Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

337
00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:39.554
The antigravity engines alone produce

338
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:41.761
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

339
00:24:43.232 --> 00:24:44.972
Feel free to be impressed.

340
00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:47.065
Wow.

341
00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:02.915
All right, we'll be
at the Antarctica entry in 48 hours.

342
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.826
This path will get us into hollow earth.

343
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:10.289
Once we're inside,
Kong should lead us to the power source.

344
00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:13.376
Now, the gravitational inversion
will be quite intense.

345
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.928
Our best guess is that on entry,
it'll feel like bungee jumping...

346
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:19.177
With the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

347
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.342
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

348
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.600
Heavs.

349
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:25.103
If your heavs are as good
as you say they are,

350
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.014
I believe we can do this.

351
00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.557
They'll do the job.

352
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:31.026
You just gotta do yours.

353
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.770
Excellent.

354
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200
Dr. Andrews.

355
00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:39.906
We've avoided all of Godzilla's
known territorial waters

356
00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:41.237
according to your guidelines.

357
00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:42.665
Good.

358
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.865
Do I need to be concerned?

359
00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:46.041
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

360
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.502
And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

361
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:51.459
The myths say that their ancestors
fought each other in a great war.

362
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.796
So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?

363
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.303
No, I spent ten years
on that island studying him.

364
00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:00.930
I know this for sure.

365
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.426
Kong bows to no one.

366
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.567
Is she supposed to be out there?

367
00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.334
Jia, come on. Come on.

368
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:57.937
Did the monkey just talk?

369
00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.838
Okay, class, listen up.

370
00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:09.032
In the midst of Godzilla's attack
on apex pensacola,

371
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:12.448
I found some crazy tech
with no official classification.

372
00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:14.627
What I saw doesn't match

373
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:16.497
any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.

374
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:19.789
So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy, hmm?

375
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.153
This could be the thread
that finally unravels

376
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.838
the apex sweater of conspiracy.

377
00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.669
You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.

378
00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:27.838
For now, I'm secure.

379
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:30.720
Anonymous and hiding in plain sight
as I continue my mission.

380
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:36.263
Breaking the law
breaking the law

381
00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:39.896
breaking the law
breaking the law

382
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.783
To be clear, my brother
can never know we took his Van.

383
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.111
Josh, to be clear,
even if we got into an accident,

384
00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:52.267
I don't think he could tell.

385
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:54.498
No, no, my brother would never
let you drive either.

386
00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:55.664
My mission, my wheel.

387
00:29:55.752 --> 00:29:57.105
I just don't think it's a good idea,

388
00:29:57.129 --> 00:29:59.165
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

389
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:01.542
I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

390
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.999
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

391
00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:05.880
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

392
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:07.461
about Godzilla and apex.

393
00:30:07.556 --> 00:30:10.138
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

394
00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:11.385
Because...

395
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.551
If we don't, nobody else will.

396
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:16.637
Are you coming or not?

397
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:18.851
Obviously I'm coming.

398
00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:21.809
It's stuck.

399
00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:24.064
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

400
00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.519
Mind control.
Read up on it, sheep.

401
00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:38.204
Psionic link technology is a reality.

402
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:40.331
That's right.
One brain controlling another.

403
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.422
Oh, man.

404
00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.122
Imagine that on a global scale
and apex is invincible.

405
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:46.082
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

406
00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.947
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

407
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.677
Whoa! Knock it off!

408
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:52.130
Walt, this is the part
I was telling you about.

409
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.203
Need special uv
to even know you've been marked!

410
00:30:54.227 --> 00:30:55.717
One or two gallons won't cut it.

411
00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:58.178
I need my bleach in bulk!

412
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.772
Because spy dust is real, people!

413
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.462
I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...

414
00:31:02.486 --> 00:31:04.088
That's how we find him.

415
00:31:04.112 --> 00:31:05.852
- The bleach.
- Bleach?

416
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:07.987
He consumes a ton of bleach.

417
00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:09.406
He drinks bleach?

418
00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:12.033
Showers with it.

419
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.907
Oh! Yeah, I shower with bleach.
No, what?

420
00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:17.664
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

421
00:31:17.834 --> 00:31:19.790
See? Tradecraft.

422
00:31:20.504 --> 00:31:22.836
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

423
00:31:28.762 --> 00:31:30.468
Come on, just one more place.

424
00:31:30.639 --> 00:31:32.721
Madison, this is getting old.

425
00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:34.556
Hey, you sell bleach?

426
00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:37.914
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

427
00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:39.624
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

428
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:41.309
I didn't know they were gonna eat them.

429
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.516
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

430
00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:46.526
Look, we're looking for a guy
who works for apex cybernetics.

431
00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:49.358
Buys a lot of bleach. Like every night.

432
00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:53.321
He's probably paranoid,
high-strung, doesn't like daylight.

433
00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:56.370
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard, if he has a beard.

434
00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:59.664
Okay, look, you kids want some candy?
Because I can help you with candy.

435
00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:03.202
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

436
00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:04.578
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

437
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:07.998
What are you doing?
You think...?

438
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:11.293
Oh, you mean Bernie.

439
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:13.507
Yeah, I know that guy.

440
00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.054
He buys, like, a ton of bleach.

441
00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:16.510
I know where he is, too.

442
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.717
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

443
00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:23.097
Bernie?

444
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:25.294
Mister... mis...

445
00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:27.630
Mister Bernie not home.

446
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:30.771
Yep, that was definitely mister Bernie.
Yeah. Um...

447
00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:35.155
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about apex and Godzilla.

448
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:37.489
No. No. No.

449
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.869
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

450
00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:42.437
For knocking on a door?

451
00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:43.746
No. No.

452
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.959
Bernie, you don't trust the authorities.
My name is Madison Russell.

453
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:50.840
My father works for monarch
and my mother was...

454
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:53.002
Emma Russell, right?

455
00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:57.715
Before we go any farther,
I got one question.

456
00:32:58.685 --> 00:32:59.925
Tap or no tap?

457
00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:01.468
No tap.

458
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.266
Excuse me, what is "tap"?
“Water.

459
00:33:04.441 --> 00:33:06.682
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

460
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:09.267
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

461
00:33:09.446 --> 00:33:10.902
Oh, I drink tap water.

462
00:33:12.032 --> 00:33:13.442
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

463
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:15.094
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

464
00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:16.608
so it should be all right.

465
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:18.443
- Thanks.
- Okay.

466
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:19.955
What you got?

467
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:24.499
I believe Godzilla's most recent attacks
haven't just been random.

468
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.705
I think he targeted the apex facility.

469
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.245
I'm of the same opinion.

470
00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:30.789
But why?
What is apex up to that's provoking him?

471
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:33.379
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

472
00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:35.418
trying to figure out
what their game was.

473
00:33:35.597 --> 00:33:37.553
Then, last week...

474
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:39.141
I saw this.

475
00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:43.764
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

476
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.208
to apex headquarters in Hong Kong,

477
00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:48.520
which makes no sense because
we are not equipped for heavy shipping.

478
00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.853
- Then what?
- And then boom!

479
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.643
Godzilla shows up.

480
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:52.853
Caved in half the facility,

481
00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:54.980
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

482
00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:56.822
which was hidden in a secret bunker.

483
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.650
I mean,
some pretty damn suspicious tech.

484
00:33:58.828 --> 00:34:00.864
Yeah, but what is that?

485
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:06.203
That's, um...

486
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:10.120
That's katzunari single malt whiskey.

487
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:12.254
Yeah, but it's in a gun holster.

488
00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:14.499
It was a gift from my Sara.

489
00:34:14.678 --> 00:34:15.678
You have a Sara”?

490
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:16.925
She was my wife.

491
00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:19.428
Um, she passed on.

492
00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:24.634
She was my rock.

493
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:26.519
My truth.

494
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.432
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

495
00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:32.233
that's the day you know I've given up.

496
00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:38.691
Bernie.

497
00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:40.950
I think we can help each other.

498
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.491
Okay, I guess now that we're a team,

499
00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:49.668
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

500
00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:51.248
We're breaking into apex.

501
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.254
- Wait, what?
- You heard her.

502
00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:54.964
Tap water.

503
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.625
Shit.

504
00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:27.698
Hey.

505
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.081
Thank you.

506
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:13.038
How is she?

507
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:16.333
Calm. So calm, it's scary.

508
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:18.585
That was extraordinary.

509
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.423
I have been signing the alphabet.
Basic commands.

510
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:25.054
I thought that he showed recognition,
but he never...

511
00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:27.807
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

512
00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.057
No.

513
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:31.435
I knew that they had a bond.

514
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.221
He trusts her.

515
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:35.227
Without her,
he'd be tearing the ship apart.

516
00:36:37.112 --> 00:36:40.229
You know, jia's parents
were killed on the island.

517
00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:44.150
When the storm took over the island,
it wiped out the native people.

518
00:36:44.327 --> 00:36:45.658
But Kong saved her.

519
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:47.785
She had nowhere to go.

520
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:51.619
So I made a promise,
then and there, to protect her.

521
00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:56.040
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

522
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.257
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

523
00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:04.596
No.

524
00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:06.804
If we have someone
who can keep the reins on Kong...

525
00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:08.889
Yeah, no one can keep the reins on Kong.

526
00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:11.931
And she's a child.

527
00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:42.923
I know jia is only a child.

528
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:46.135
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

529
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:50.424
And we need Kong
to find that power source.

530
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:54.018
The world needs him.

531
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.608
What's she saying?

532
00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:09.953
Godzilla.

533
00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:20.916
Did we change course?

534
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.001
No. We're nowhere
near the areas you flagged.

535
00:38:23.176 --> 00:38:24.916
It looks like he's coming for us anyway.

536
00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:26.280
He's not coming for us.

537
00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.716
Him? Then dump him. Dump the monkey!

538
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.881
How about we throw you off instead, huh?

539
00:38:32.936 --> 00:38:34.096
We have to release him.

540
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.750
If we lose Kong, the mission is over.

541
00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:37.014
He's a sitting duck out there.

542
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:39.062
We have to let him protect himself.
And us.

543
00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.356
Delta...

544
00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:34.837
Oh, my god, jia!

545
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:36.051
Nathan?

546
00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:29.576
He needs our help.

547
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.532
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

548
00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:32.913
Depth charges.

549
00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:19.883
Run!

550
00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:45.989
He's circling back.

551
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.572
This won't end
until one of them submits.

552
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.413
Shut it down. “What?

553
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:55.332
All of it.

554
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:56.959
Guns, engines.

555
00:45:57.505 --> 00:46:00.212
- Shut it down. Right now.
- If we do that, we're dead.

556
00:46:00.383 --> 00:46:02.123
No, we're playing dead.

557
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:03.901
And we're making him think
that he's won.

558
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:11.675
Cut the power. Cut the engines.
Kill anything that makes a noise.

559
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:26.481
This better work.

560
00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:20.664
As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

561
00:47:21.297 --> 00:47:23.663
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

562
00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:32.464
How's Kong with heights?

563
00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:44.350
So, what's the plan?

564
00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:47.065
We find out
what's on sublevel 33.

565
00:47:47.156 --> 00:47:48.316
Ow.

566
00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:50.068
Keep it moving, tap water.

567
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:54.489
Go ahead.

568
00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:06.081
All right, mad hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

569
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.291
Okay. We got this.

570
00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:11.054
Oh, my god!

571
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:12.491
Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

572
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:13.515
Yeah, why?

573
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.639
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

574
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.597
and carries a bottle of whiskey
from his dead wife like a gun.

575
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.811
I think it's romantic.

576
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:21.898
\wwhoo-hoo!

577
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.061
I really don't understand women.

578
00:48:42.503 --> 00:48:43.959
Okay, come on.

579
00:48:50.386 --> 00:48:52.968
This whole thing came down,
and there was this...

580
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:54.931
Eye.

581
00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:57.881
Uh, what are we looking at?

582
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.392
No, no, no, no. No, it was here.

583
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:03.145
I swear to god, it was...
It was right there.

584
00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:04.354
Hey, guys.

585
00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:09.734
Anyone know where this leads to?

586
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.240
You believe me, right?

587
00:49:12.324 --> 00:49:13.885
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

588
00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:15.865
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

589
00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:20.367
"Sublevel."
how deep does this thing go, Bernie?

590
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:22.827
Hell. Goes to hell.

591
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:25.534
Sublevel 33.

592
00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:29.234
Maglev shuttle departure

593
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:32.341
to roswell new Mexico at 0900 hours.

594
00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:38.051
Whoa.

595
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.760
What is all this?

596
00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:45.012
It's breakaway civilization.

597
00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:49.855
I mean, come on. This is page one
in the apex-playing-god handbook. Huh?

598
00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:53.112
I mean, the illuminati
running shadow economies

599
00:49:53.199 --> 00:49:55.440
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

600
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:58.367
in case any of these governments
and megacorporations

601
00:49:58.454 --> 00:50:00.570
accidentally hit the doomsday button.

602
00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:04.035
- It makes sense if you think about it.
- Yeah, sure.

603
00:50:06.754 --> 00:50:07.939
Someone's coming. “What?

604
00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:08.963
Someone's coming. “What?

605
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.728
- Someone's coming?
- Yes!

606
00:50:15.054 --> 00:50:16.510
Oh, my god.

607
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:23.892
- They look like eggs.
- Skull-crawlers.

608
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.766
What's apex doing with skull-crawlers?

609
00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:28.293
All right, let's load it up!

610
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:31.107
What was that? What was that?

611
00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:33.115
No way. No, no, no. Come on.

612
00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:35.070
Okay, guys, I think we're moving.

613
00:50:52.466 --> 00:50:55.208
It says we're headed
to apex headquarters in Hong Kong.

614
00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:56.758
- What?
- Hong Kong.

615
00:50:56.929 --> 00:50:59.045
That means that
we're gonna get some answers.

616
00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:01.134
G10, clear for launch.

617
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:13.027
Here we go.

618
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:44.802
We're getting close!

619
00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:58.390
It's not working.

620
00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:00.733
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

621
00:54:00.821 --> 00:54:03.779
What if she tells him
there are others down there like him?

622
00:54:04.825 --> 00:54:05.860
But you don't know that.

623
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:08.575
We lost our entire fleet getting here.

624
00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:11.195
There's no way back for him.

625
00:54:11.874 --> 00:54:13.739
And he can't survive here.

626
00:54:27.055 --> 00:54:29.046
All right. All right.

627
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:37.061
Hey.

628
00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:24.067
He's going. Prepare to launch!
Everybody to their station.

629
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.154
We gotta go.

630
00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:40.000
All flights crews cleared
for immediate heayv launch.

631
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.915
Heav 1 online.
We're clear for launch.

632
00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:44.997
Copy that, heav 1.

633
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:48.008
Heav 2 online.
Exiting hangar now.

634
00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:51.295
Heav 2, confirmation 4055.

635
00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:54.014
This is heav 3 online,
launching now.

636
00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:55.598
We'll follow him from behind.

637
00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:16.407
There.

638
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.246
There he is.

639
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:34.130
Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

640
00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:36.632
Oh, he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

641
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.847
We're about to be launched
1,000 miles in two seconds

642
00:56:40.022 --> 00:56:44.732
until gravity inverts itself
and spits us into free fall.

643
00:56:46.737 --> 00:56:49.023
It'll be the most amazing thing
you've ever seen.

644
00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:53.072
Here. For the vomit.

645
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:54.243
What?

646
00:57:56.765 --> 00:57:59.973
Engine failure, gravity low.

647
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:01.929
Engine failure.

648
00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:37.086
All delta, reverse gravity propulsion!

649
00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:45.195
It's beautiful.

650
00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:47.580
This is heav 3,

651
00:59:47.667 --> 00:59:49.307
we're getting some
strange radar activity.

652
00:59:49.628 --> 00:59:50.993
We're gonna circle back and...

653
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.699
All delta, prepare to attack!

654
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.249
That's gross.

655
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.841
Kong's on the move. We gotta go.

656
01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.289
Well he seems to know where he's going.

657
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:56.747
Oh, he certainly can move.

658
01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:25.957
Okay, okay.

659
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.050
Creepy monorail is slowing down.

660
01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.429
Aftention:
Shipping pod arriving.

661
01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.441
Okay. Keep quiet. Follow me.

662
01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:50.617
We're going in?

663
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:51.945
Yeanh.

664
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.541
Oh, no!

665
01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:01.459
Every time, I swear. Doors hate us.

666
01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.705
Oh, yeah.

667
01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:11.628
- Aah!
- Oh, my god!

668
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:15.891
It's just so massive. It's so stupid.

669
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.093
So, what is this place?

670
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.977
Well, if there's
a corporate-friendly term

671
01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:21.430
for "sacrifice pit,"

672
01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.940
I'd say we are in it.

673
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.152
Oh, god, that stinks.

674
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.401
That's not good. Bernie!

675
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:35.939
I really hate this place.

676
01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.994
Attention: Demonstration

677
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.997
in t-minus one minute.

678
01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:49.049
All personnel
are to stay clear of the area.

679
01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:01.102
Mr. Simmons,
systems are coming online now.

680
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.586
Commence uplink.

681
01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.917
Engaging uplink.

682
01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.339
Pilot engaged.

683
01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:07.456
That's robot Godzilla.

684
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.245
Oh, no. That's...

685
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.130
That's mechagodzilla.

686
01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.109
Release number 10.

687
01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.994
Go, go! Go through there!
Madison!

688
01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.958
Madison! Run, girl!

689
01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.588
Run, girl. Go!

690
01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:19.952
Yes!

691
01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.627
Damn it.

692
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.915
System only reached 40% power.

693
01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.093
Oh, I know.

694
01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:37.546
As expected.

695
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.803
Don't worry. Once the hollow earth
sample is uploaded,

696
01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:43.010
our power troubles will be over.

697
01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:45.049
If they can find the source.

698
01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:48.891
Oh, they'll find it.
I have faith in my daughter.

699
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.397
I have faith in our creation.

700
01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.184
And humanity will once again...

701
01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.607
Be the apex species.

702
01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:01.574
This is why Godzilla attacked
the apex facility.

703
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.868
They're trying to replace him.

704
01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:32.096
Come on, maddie.

705
01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:36.602
Sir, Godzilla just made
an abrupt change in direction.

706
01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:37.981
He's moving very fast.

707
01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:40.529
Projections show
he's likely headed to Hong Kong.

708
01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.365
Transport is ready
and waiting to take you there, sir.

709
01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:05.804
That has to be it.

710
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.881
We were right.

711
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.346
He's home.

712
01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.094
All personnel must display

713
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.392
their apex employee badge at all times.

714
01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.021
Follow me.

715
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:44.812
Lizard people build all their facilities
the same way. I can find the exit.

716
01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:48.690
The exit's this way.

717
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.189
Guys. Madison!

718
01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:02.791
Oh, my god.

719
01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:07.042
Bitch, what?

720
01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:09.248
It's a titan skull.

721
01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:14.053
That's monster zero.

722
01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.381
Ghidorah.

723
01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.849
They hardwired its DNA.

724
01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.015
Self-generating neural pathways

725
01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:27.100
capable of intuitive learning.

726
01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.339
Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

727
01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:31.399
- It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

728
01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:36.363
It had three heads.

729
01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:40.201
Its necks were so long,
they communicated telepathically.

730
01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:43.958
And there's one here
and another one inside of that thing.

731
01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:46.289
Yeah, it could be a psionic interface.

732
01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.754
Oh, my god.

733
01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:51.503
Careful.

734
01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:52.802
It's a pilot.

735
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.632
Yeah. He's in a trance.

736
01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.005
That's a psionic uplink.

737
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.301
It follows his will.

738
01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:04.103
Oh, apex, what have you done?

739
01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:50.103
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order, doctor.

740
01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:52.277
The city is being evacuated.

741
01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:03.321
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

742
01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:24.596
What is he doing?

743
01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.839
It's the axe.

744
01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:59.294
It's drawing radiation from the core
like it's charging.

745
01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:44.927
Whoa! Godzilla's responding!
They found it!

746
01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.432
What in the hell?

747
01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:05.655
What are you doing?

748
01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.744
Extracting a sample.

749
01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.997
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

750
01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.540
You can't just drill into it.

751
01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.450
Actually, we can.

752
01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.338
My father gets what he wants.

753
01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:19.840
That's apex property now.

754
01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:21.341
What?

755
01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:29.308
Energy signature incoming.

756
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.557
We should be able to recreate it soon.

757
01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:37.934
That is the discovery of the millennium.

758
01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:40.273
- You can't strip it for parts.
- Hold it.

759
01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:08.134
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

760
01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:09.674
Let's go!

761
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.093
Yes.

762
01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.393
Mr. serizawa, start your engines!

763
01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:17.940
The upgrade is untested.

764
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.193
Once we get online,
gojira will come straight for us.

765
01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:25.031
He's been coming for us
since our creation first awoke.

766
01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.487
We must embrace it.
We shouldn't rush this.

767
01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:30.698
We have no idea how this energy source
will affect the mecha.

768
01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.488
Get in the goddamn chair.

769
01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:49.968
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

770
01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.970
Move! What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

771
01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:02.359
This way, sir! Hurry!
We gotta get back...

772
01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:29.931
Okay.

773
01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.918
Get him out of the way! Shoot him!

774
01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:12.758
Go, go, go!

775
01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:22.855
Oh, no.

776
01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.812
No, no, no...

777
01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:30.189
Oh, Jesus! Come on, let's go!

778
01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:00.143
- Hold on, ladies.
- Yeah.

779
01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:02.106
Whoa.

780
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.665
Stay low.

781
01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:36.763
Yeah. Going viral.

782
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.559
What?

783
01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:41.093
We've gotta try and stop this.

784
01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.689
I don't like this, guys.

785
01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:47.754
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction,

786
01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:49.143
this would be a great dj booth.

787
01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:54.819
I know what it... maintenance.

788
01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:56.471
Madison, we should go.

789
01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.139
I'm maintenance.
You don't have to alert the...

790
01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.058
She doesn't buy that.
Uh, Madison, we need to go.

791
01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:01.267
The woman with the villain hairdo,

792
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.061
- she's getting security.
- Madison, they have guns.

793
01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:06.202
Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof
so I can't really...

794
01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.166
- I wanna communicate...
- Open the door!

795
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.420
Say again?

796
01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.297
Oh, god! Get down! Get down!

797
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.299
Oh, shit!

798
01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.619
We're about to breach the veil! Hold on!

799
01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:04.194
Looks like round two goes to Kong.

800
01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:17.672
Hey!

801
01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:25.840
Oh, come on, guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

802
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.631
Greenpea...

803
01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.970
Actually, sir,
not like you would know this,

804
01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.847
but I'm level two
assistant engineering...

805
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.353
Well, provisional level two
assistant engineering,

806
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.725
not like you would know that.

807
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.856
My evaluations
were incredibly encourag...

808
01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:42.986
I'm just saying Greenpeace wishes,
is all I'm saying.

809
01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:46.739
Where do I know you from?

810
01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.365
Oh, my goodness.

811
01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:54.619
Director Russell's daughter, yes?

812
01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:56.616
You caused all of this.

813
01:26:56.795 --> 01:27:00.959
If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

814
01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:03.545
have given humanity a chance
against the titans,

815
01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:06.506
then, yes, I will own that title.

816
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.012
Godzilla had left us in peace.

817
01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:10.922
You provoked him into war.

818
01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:13.763
There can only be one Alpha,
miss Russell.

819
01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:16.519
It seems to have been Providence.

820
01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:10.314
It's time to launch.
Begin pilot integration.

821
01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.494
And now...

822
01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:21.905
My mecha.

823
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.625
It's not only Godzilla's equal...

824
01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:29.454
But his superior.

825
01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:35.085
The apex titan of my own hand.

826
01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:39.593
It's time to show
the world what you can do.

827
01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.885
Pilot engaged.

828
01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:51.106
Alert: Failure. System unstable.

829
01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:55.067
Alert: Failure. System unstable.

830
01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:00.652
This is how we, as a species, win.

831
01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.579
You see, ten years ago,

832
01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:07.208
when gojira was first revealed
to the world,

833
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:09.540
I had a dream.

834
01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:12.877
And in that dream, I saw one thing.

835
01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:18.671
And that beautiful, amazing thing was...

836
01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:22.890
Oh, shit.

837
01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:24.061
Nol

838
01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.236
It's unfair.

839
01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.283
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

840
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:19.234
What in god's name is that?

841
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:06.486
It's thinking for itself now.

842
01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.196
We have to warn monarch.

843
01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:10.907
Or try to stop it ourselves.

844
01:33:11.628 --> 01:33:13.230
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

845
01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.790
Wait, Josh.

846
01:33:15.465 --> 01:33:19.049
If I can figure out the password,
maybe we can shut it down.

847
01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:20.219
All right.

848
01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.602
What the hell is that?

849
01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:30.490
What?

850
01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:35.792
What's happening?

851
01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:38.286
She can feel his heartbeat.

852
01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.000
He's dying.

853
01:34:42.635 --> 01:34:44.671
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

854
01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.162
We'd need a charge big enough to...

855
01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:47.883
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

856
01:35:11.414 --> 01:35:13.334
Is that a password?

857
01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:15.410
Is that a password?

858
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:16.901
I don't know! I'm not used to this.

859
01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:18.576
I'm used to pirating movies online.

860
01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:20.149
Okay, then go to settings.

861
01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:21.453
- This is Mark.
- Dad?

862
01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.581
Madison, where are you?

863
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.375
Dad, can you hear...

864
01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:27.715
Can you hear me? I'm in Hong Kong.

865
01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:29.254
- Mad?
- Dad!

866
01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:31.263
Mad? Madison!

867
01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.140
A-hal

868
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:42.521
okay, you two better get some distance.

869
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.366
Hey.

870
01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:54.321
You are a very brave little girl.

871
01:36:02.882 --> 01:36:04.042
I don't know.

872
01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:05.840
Maybe we both are.

873
01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:45.792
Okay.

874
01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:51.340
Good luck, big fella.

875
01:38:26.776 --> 01:38:28.128
I thought you said you were a hacker!

876
01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:30.108
I said I took an html course
at summer camp.

877
01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:31.769
- Html?
- Yes, at summer camp.

878
01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:34.189
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use qwerty.

879
01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:36.528
Error. Security lock.

880
01:38:36.702 --> 01:38:38.909
No. Shit!

881
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.445
Shit.

882
01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:20.002
Josh! You have to do something.

883
01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:22.175
We tried to take down
those apex bastards,

884
01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.452
but I think this is as far as we go,

885
01:40:23.476 --> 01:40:24.841
so bottom's up.

886
01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:26.975
I was hoping to die with adults,
but okay.

887
01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:33.629
If you've never
had a drink before,

888
01:40:33.653 --> 01:40:34.768
now's the time cause...

889
01:40:35.363 --> 01:40:36.648
Drink. Drink!

890
01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:38.754
Hey! What are you...

891
01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:42.025
That's your solution?

892
01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:44.110
I gotta die here with you, and sober!

893
01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.255
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

894
01:42:02.658 --> 01:42:03.943
Hey, Nathan?

895
01:42:05.578 --> 01:42:07.193
Nathan?

896
01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:09.153
Nathan, are you okay?

897
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:34.189
Dad?

898
01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:36.816
Dad!

899
01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:38.818
- Dad!
- I love you.

900
01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:50.407
Hi. Um, it was, um... Madison's idea.

901
01:42:51.666 --> 01:42:53.247
Shut up, Josh.

902
01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:56.830
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

903
01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:58.244
Bernie, meet dad.

904
01:42:58.422 --> 01:42:59.912
Dad. Uh, Bernie.

905
01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.647
Um, it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

906
01:43:01.717 --> 01:43:05.050
I was wondering
if I could invite you onto my podcast

907
01:43:05.221 --> 01:43:08.384
to talk about the monarch facility
in roswell because...

908
01:43:14.313 --> 01:43:15.644
It's amazing. It happened...

909
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:30.985
Jia? Jial

910
01:44:46.155 --> 01:44:49.147
Heads up, guys! He's coming
around for his morning walk.

911
01:45:07.927 --> 01:45:10.384
Sometimes

912
01:45:12.515 --> 01:45:14.722
all I need is the air that I breathe

913
01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:18.676
and to love you

914
01:45:19.772 --> 01:45:23.811
all I need is the air that I breathe

915
01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:27.143
yes, to love you

916
01:45:28.113 --> 01:45:34.734
all I need is the air that I breathe

917
01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.587
Sometimes

918
01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.884
all I need is the air that I breathe

919
01:45:51.971 --> 01:45:53.836
and to love you

920
01:45:56.058 --> 01:46:00.142
all I need is the air that I breathe

921
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:02.936
and to love you

922
01:46:04.358 --> 01:46:08.397
all I need is the air that I breathe

923
01:46:08.487 --> 01:46:10.648
yes, to love you

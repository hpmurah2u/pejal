26
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.150
I passed the interview in my company.

It was because of you.

Thank you. Thank you, pleng.

Okay, okay, enough.

Actually, I need your help.

32
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.040
I want to break up with my boyfriend.

33
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.110
Okay, and then?

34
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.140
He can't speak English,
and I could not speak Thai.

35
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.250
You can not talk to each other, and how you can
together?

36
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.120
You know, the S-E-X. It was all about sex.

37
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.030
Because sex is my life.

38
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.100

But...

45
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.070
I bought,
Louis Vuitton bag for you.

46
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.080
Oh, yea. Breaking up with a guy
is so easy. Don't worry.

47
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.010
Thank you.

48
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.320

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.320

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.040
You do not have eyes?

55
00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.060
Keep your movements. The world is very narrow.

56
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.150
Are you Jim? Kaya's girlfriend?

57
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.100
I have something to tell you Jim.

58
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.160

Your attitude.

67
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.190
Your religion.

68
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.120
I'm only a couple of seasons here.

69
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.330
It will be a good memory.
Very good memories.

70
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.330
I do not understand.

71
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.190
Can you repeat it again?

72
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.170
Uh, no problem.
I can repeat it for you.

73
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.300
We start.

74
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.140
- Jim, sorry I did not tell you...
- Needless to say?

75
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.310
- This is nonsense.
- Do not be angry, Kaya's request.

76
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.160
Are you sure? What was
really her voice?

77
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.290
Yes.

78
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.220
You're a liar.

79
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.290
Do not play games with me.

80
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.040
What are you looking??

81
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.300
- Do not look there.
- The man was crazy.

82
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.160
Is that a bomb?

83
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.100

It was not a bomb. Watch your mouth.

86
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.200
- Hey, what's that?
- It's chicken soup.

87
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.100
Chicken soup?

88
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.300
- This chicken meat.
- Fuck.

89
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.260
- He's crazy or what?
- You know that guy?

90
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.030
Oh, I do not know him.

91
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.140
- Shit.
- So you know him?

92
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.210
I do not know him.

93
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.180
- He's crazy or what?
- So you broke up with him.

94
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.160
None of your business.

95
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.030
Oh, God. Help me.

96
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.300
No...

97
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.180
Hey, what do you want?

Do not approaching.

99
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.130
I'm going to hit you.

100
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.170
I still have one more.

101
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.260
Who are you?

102
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.140
Why are you meddling in my affairs with Kaya?

103
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.300
I'll teach you.

104
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.210
You bastard. No wonder
Kaya wanted to break up with you.

105

Hey!

You tell her, I do not want to break up with her.

107
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.080
I just did what she asked me.

108
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.320
I do not care.
I want you to teach me English.

109

Look, I'll pay you if you teach me English.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.330
- Teach me?
- Yes, I will teach you.

If not...

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.130
You probably do not want to hear it.

117
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.250
The payout is very low.

You do not sleep?

119
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.310
Go to sleep.

do not have money, and they insulted me.

So, you will have to speak English as much as possible.

138
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.190
I need full attention and participation.

184
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.220
Oh, mango hung there.

185
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.280
Do you need a ride?

186
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.280
Not. I never drive a motorcycle.
I'm afraid with the motor.

187
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.250
By the way, thank you.

188
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.220
Why do not you just remove your clothes?

189
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.230
Sordid.

190
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.300
Do not ever think about it.

191
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.280
- That for me?
- Mmm.

192
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.180
Why do not you try it?
Maybe it will make you more beautiful.

193
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.120
I hope you succeed.
Not wait to see your face when you know the truth.

194
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.120
That you're just a sex toy.

195
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.150
Careful. The parking place is haunted.

196
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.320
One Minute Speech.

197
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.240
- May I take it?
- Yes.

198
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.050
Mole.

199
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.050
You're going to talk about moles.

200
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.190
- May I talking about you?
- Yes sure.

201
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.230
Okay.

202
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.190
You started.

203
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.270
Uh, moles.

204
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:47.300
Moles is destiny in action

205
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.120
Moles are small miracle of destiny.

206
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:59.220
Because, no one can predict where and when
moles will appear.

207
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.280
Or even eventually end up in their bodies.

208
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.060
Moles appear to be random.

209
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.170
But... But if the mole is completely random,
then how two people, wholly foreign roang.

210
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.070
Have a mole in the same spot.

211
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.070
Maybe it was destiny.

212
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.280
You see, moles
and destiny is no different.

213
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.250
If you wait to meet people who
have a mole in the same place ..

214
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.120
It is almost impossible.

215
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.220
That is why...

216
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.200
We need to write our own destiny.

217
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.090
Oh, what's wrong here?

218
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.160
Hey, how long you will see the board?

219
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.190
Kaya.

220
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.030
What? That means
conversation classes for business.

221
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.200
- I'm glad for it.
- What's that?

222
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.210
- I fell in love.
- That's sweet.

223
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.310
Kua fall in love with your pupils?

224
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:47.200
Do not tell anyone,
or I'll kill you.

225
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.090
Hey, bye, sweet DeeDee.

226
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.230
Strange.

227
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.110
What do you like to eat?

228
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.270
I want to eat Mama.

229
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:09.280
- What is Mama?
- Oh, Mama is the food of Thailand.

230
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.260
Nobody will know Mama
if not from Thailand.

231
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.220
So what do you want me to say?

232
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.170
What time do you go to bed?

233
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:37.040
- Uh... well...
- Come on, it's an easy question.

234
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:44.250
What time do you go to bed? Tonight,
midnight, you can say something.

235
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.050
Midnight is when the killer stab.

236
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.290
You're very funny.

237
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.130
What do you like to do in your free time?

238
00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.100
Uh, I like to play cards.

239
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.080
Use English.
I like to play cards.

240
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:12.080
I love listening to music,
and what about you?

241
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.180
What should I say?

242
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.180
Tell me about yourself.

243
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.230

- I'll never do it again. Promise.

265
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.290
Did you delete them?

266
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.090
Anything else?

267
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.130
Get out of here!

268
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.040
- Apologize to her.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

269
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:53.120
Okay, if I saw you again.
I will cut off your penis.

- Hey!
- What the hell? What are you doing?

271

Oi! Let me go!

272
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:10.060
You're saying it wrong, it should be
password instead of Patword.

273
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.190
Hey.

274
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.210
What the fuck?

275

Disgusting!

277
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.110
Give me a tissue.

278
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.160
- I do not have.
- Use it.

279
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:40.030
- This is called a handkerchief. Not tissue.
- Hey.

280
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.140
It's disgusting.

281
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.130
I still smell something.

282
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.240
Damn!

283
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.240
Oh, shit!

284
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.280
- There's nothing left?
- It was clean.

285
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.230
Why are you still here?

286
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.130
Wassup man?

287
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.160
How are you?

288
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.070
What is it?

289
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.310
Uh, happy dolphins.

Here, put it.

294
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.160
Let's look at the other books.

295
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.200
Cinderella. Sleeping Beauty.

296
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:33.070
I already know it.
I prefer dolphins.

297
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.210
Excuse me. Do you speak English?
Can you?

298
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.010
Can you?

299
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.180
Oh, perfect. Hey... Good.

300
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:52.090
I'm looking for this restaurant, you know that?
You've been there before?

301
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.260
I heard it was very good.

302
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.130
- Talk to him.
- You were talking to him.

303
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.300
What is remote, it does not matter.
I can take a taxi. Not a problem at all.

304
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.070
What should I tell him?

305
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.240
Oh, let alone to
ask other people.

306
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.150
[USED THAILAND]
Ask it to someone else.

307
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.170
Kai? I don't understand, what Kai?

308
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.050
Tell him to use gestures.

309
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.280
[USED THAILAND]
Ask the other person only.

310

[USING ENGLISH]
Far? How far? How far? How far do you think?

Hey, how is it going?

312

She is his friend.

313
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.060
I think the place was still far away.

- Yes? Do you know?
- You can only mark the area, no problem.

320
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.240
- Do you know where it is, is not it?
- I do not know what you say.

321
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.140
Yeah, this, this one?

322
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.210

- Hi there ..

323

Hey,

326
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.230
You've got a lot to learn English,
so that such incidents do not happen again.

327
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.180
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

328
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.300
What are you doing?

329
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.040
I want to bring the rest home.

330

You've finished eating?
I'll take it.

331
00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.020
Why do not you buy it?

332
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.190
I do not want to leave food.

333

- Do you really want to eat it?
- I'll eat it.

334
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.330
I'll eat it, then I'm going to sleep.

335
00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.070
So what if you're still hungry?

336
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.130
I will stay asleep.

337

- If you are hungry, do you sleep?
- If you can not sleep ..

338
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.200
I would force myself to stay asleep.

339
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.110
Do not feel now it was late.

340
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.060
True. Time does not seem
if we have activities.

341

We've arrived, stop .. Stopped here.

342
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.190
- We've arrived. Hmm.
- This is where you live?

343
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.240
(Are you asleep?)

344

What you do not want to go down?

345
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.150
Who is it?

346
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.120
- It's not your affair.
- Oh ..

347
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.320
You do not need to feel shame on me.
If he's your lover just tell me.

348
00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.120
It's my boyfriend.

- Is he really your lover?
- Yes it is.

350

Hmmm...

351
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.070
You should not have to lie
if it's just your friend.

352
00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:55.270
Yes, he is really my lover.
Anyway it has nothing to do with you.

353
00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:00.050
Are you the first
seduce him, so that he likes you?

354

See you again.

481
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.280
One day worrying about
palace prince who wants to have his queen.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:17.290
Cinderella down from the carriage and realized that he was standing

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.260
Cinderella dancing with the prince, song after song.

490
00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.070
You look very pretty.

491
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:58.240
They both look happy for each other.

492
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.080
This is my collection of cars.

493
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.050
This is my family heritage.

494
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.150
You wait a minute here.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.250
And right in the middle of the night,

497
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.210
Before the spell is lost,

498
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:40.310
Cinderella sadly say goodbye to the prince.

499
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:44.290
It was late, I had to go home.

In a hurry, he

501
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:57.230
The Prince really fall in love with her, he invited all the women
to palace to match the shoe size to meet Cinderella.

502
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.260
It belongs to whom?

503
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.100
Wait a minute.

504
00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:08.080
Not in a long time, the prince was finally united with Cinderela
again.

511
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:49.040
(Yes)

512
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:52.280
And they lived happily ever after.

513
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.160
The end.

514
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:18.110

519
00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:04.090
What about him? He looked uneasy.

520
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:12.090
Hey, do not make him upset.
His mood was not that nice.

521
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.090
I understand.

522
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.130
What should we do?

523
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:26.210
Listen, we have to comfort him
so he is happy.

524
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.190
But, how do we make it so he entertained?

525
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.190

Recite this sentence for me.

535
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.290
Read for me.

536
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.050
Stop that.

537
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:25.070
I want to apologize.

538
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.190
- For what?
- Because it has made you upset.

539
00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:31.200
I just want to help you.

540
00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:39.150
If you want to help me, you have to teach me
English.

541
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.310
Okay.

542
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:46.090
I will start to teach you English.

543
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:52.120
I will try, so you
can go there to see her.

544
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:54.150
Really?

545
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.030
Of course.

546
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.090
You certainly can.

547
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.060
Let's do it.

548
00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.300
Doing what?

549
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:06.140
Learning English.

550
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:14.210
- Hey, have you no idea anymore?
- I'm afraid we'll fail again.

551
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:20.120
I do not want to be a target of anger.

552
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.060
Everyone, she is pleng.

553
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:35.070
Stand up

554
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:41.140
Good evening, teacher.

555
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.270
How are you?

556
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.180
I'm fine, thank you.
And you?

557
00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.190
I'm good. And I
glad to meet you guys.

558
00:54:52.190 --> 00:55:00.030
Let me translate, I
glad to meet you.

559
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:08.200
Are these all from your department?

560
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:14.070
Are these all from your department?

561
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.310
Good.

562
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:22.050
Okay, let's start the interview.

563
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:28.110
Okay, let's start the interview.

564
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.090
Hmm, you have progress.

565
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:34.060
We have to think about about
what questions will be submitted.

566
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.190
That is why we gather
to discuss.

567
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:42.030
Begin!

568
00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.200
I know you want this interview
pass in order to meet with her, right?

569
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.180
That is not your concern.

570
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:51.080
Hey, do not play play again.

571
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:56.110
Approximately what is going on in the interview later
ask him.

572
00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.180
He will be asked about something
that detail, detail, detail ..

573
00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:04.090
Hey, stop it, it will not be asked.

574
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:14.130
I think it is what he meant by
detail, detail, detail is a job.

575
00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:20.040
- Okay, are there any others?
- I do not know, I started going to think about it.

576
00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.040
- What else?
- I think he will be asked,

577
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:25.310
What English skills.

578
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:29.270
True, but I want you
first snap of your moustache.

579
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:34.090
I could flick the feathers below.

580
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.250
You will also be in question
ability to work there.

581
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:40.230
No problem, I've mastered all of it.

582
00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:45.170
Good,
I'm sure you will definitely pass the interview.

583
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:50.040
Hey, why are you so
happy, it does not concern you.

584
00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.210
Waw,

585
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.190
He swiftly to dance.

586
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.030
Hey, why don't you dance with them?

587
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.060
I can not dance like that.

588
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.170
Look, she will begin to teach us.

589
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.150
True. We will start from the letters A to Z.

590
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:39.180
Say it correctly.

591
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.050
I guess, we'll
do in the game.

592
00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:44.150
Hey, it's true, he said a good idea.

593
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.130
I'll take it.

594
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.260
We will start the game words.

595
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.100
If you can not get a blow.

596
00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.230
Start.

597
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:56.100
- X
- A

598
00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:57.270
- T
- M

599
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.240
You think I can not?

600
00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.080


601
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:03.240
Y

602
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.050
- P.
- was not included.

603
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.050
D!

604
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.310


605
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.220
Come on, come on, you can do it.

606
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.190
A.

607
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.130
- Come on...
- Q!

608
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:26.300
- K.
- What is it? K?

609
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.040
What? Whether it is okay?

610
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.130
I know! As my mouth,
as my mouth...

611
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.300
That's not true, it's cheating.

612
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:38.250
- What did you say?
- You're destroying it.

613
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.150
You lose...

614
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:45.050
No, no, no...
X!

615
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:47.180
- You're wrong!
- What Are?

616
00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:51.180
- I win.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

617
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:57.290
here this evening!

618
00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:03.260
- Ouch, that hurts...
- What is pain?

619
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:07.040
Why did you stab him so deeply?

620
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.110
Are you ready?

621
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:14.170
1, 2, 3...

622
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.290
Carefully...

623
00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:30.060
Why did not explode?

624
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.160
It begins!

625
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.070
- Do not point here!
- What?

626
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.300
Navigate there, it's dangerous!

627
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.050
It was so great.

628
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.280
Ouch.

629
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.220
- Shit.
- Ass on fire.

630
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.290
Burned my poor buttocks.

631
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:01.130
- Do you have a big butt once.
- It flies like a rocket.

632
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.290
That's so awesome!

633
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.260
Oh...

634
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.040
... Oh

635
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.200
What? Why are you squatting there?

636
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:15.130
- I can not stand.
- It's nice, is not it?

637
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.210
Hey, why did you write it like this?

638
01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.120
Note your eyes, do not look at me.

639
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:40.100
What are you doing?

640
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:48.040
- I wrote it here.
- You write there?

641
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:54.140
- Why do not you write it in a book?
- It's easier to carry with me.

642
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.280
I like something simple.

643
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:07.060
Well, I guess there is no longer
who can teach you.

644
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.100
There are many more things to learn.

645
01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.330
I want to learn the most difficult grammar.

646
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.200
There are so many words
can not say or understand.

647
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.280
Hey!

648
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.110
- What are you doing?
- I'm here.

649
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.060
- Basic insolent woman!
- Hey, I'm here.

650
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.250
Here, here...

651
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.250
... Here

652
01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:44.120
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

653
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:47.100
The streets are so crowded in the evenings.

654
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.230
Yes.

655
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.140
Come on...

656
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.150
- What are we going home?
- I think so.

657
01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:02.110
- Do you know the way home?
- I think so, I'm trying to remember.

658
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:04.250
Stop right there.

659
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.190
- Let's go.
- How do you take it where I am?

660
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.060
We will cross the road.

661
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.110
Hey, wait for me!

662
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:32.080
Oh, shit!

663
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.180
Why are you laughing?

664
01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:20.060
Look for yourself.

665
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:26.130
Damn, my eyes like a cat's.

666
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:31.210
Do not tease me.

667
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.180
nozzle.

668
01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:47.050
At idle speeds, what size of nozzle should we use?

669
01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.030
Dictionary of Engineering.

670
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:59.130
Is nozzle size depends on the speed?

671
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:07.170
It's easier to carry with me.
I like something simple.

672
01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:17.250
It will make everything so much easier to use.

673
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.130
I want to learn the most difficult languages.

674
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:37.210
What makes it work,
in the best way.

675
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.110
Been a long time since I
sail with the ship.

676
01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.200
Do you like it?

677
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:23.050
I need to calm my mind...

678
01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.080
- I understand. - I always come here
to calm my mind.

679
01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.220
This is one of my favourite places.

680
01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:38.190
- Since when did you learn to sail?
- I learned from my father.

681
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:41.030
Do you want to learn?

682
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.130
Do you need help?

683
01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:49.070
Let me help you...

684
01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.050
Damn! It's very painful.

685
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.050
I am very happy to be here with you.

686
01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:32.080
You make me ashamed.

687
01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.260
There is something to say.

688
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:42.130
- This is something that is very important.
- Important?

689
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.080
True Love Story.

690
01:06:54.110 --> 01:07:01.210
# I've never felt like this in my life...

691
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:07.050
# Every time I see your face...

692
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.090
# My heart is beating so fast...

693
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.150
# pounding so fast...

694
01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:22.200
# My heart is crying for you...

695
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.170
I love you so much.

696
01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:35.050
I know it.

697
01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:39.180
But what you do not want to live
slowly?

698
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.250
Do not waste your time.

699
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:50.060
But we just know each other
not so long.

700
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:53.100
I do not care.

701
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.270
Is that so?

702
01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:03.170
So, what do you say you want to stop just
?

703
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.270
Note what I said!

704
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.050
- Oh, notice, I understand.
- Yes I Do.

705
01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.090
It's like when I took the oath.

706
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.080
- Pledge? Can you pronounce it?
- I said it.

707
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.290
- I deliberately say it.
- Intentionally?

708
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:22.130
- But you say, is not it?
- I said it correctly.

709
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.130
- Okay, dear.
- I'm very excited.

710
01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:36.040
Ah, come here a minute.

711
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.080
This is for you.

712
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.110
I thought you would give me. For Me!

713
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.280
I am very disappointed!

714
01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.300
Let me try it one by one, okay?

715
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:10.270
Good, the next...

716
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.250
Try this one.

717
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.270
Let me help you.

718
01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:20.120
It fits all.

719
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.180
Let's see.

720
01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.290
I think quite hard to find size.

721
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:33.100
I will find it, even
make it for yourself.

722
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.190
It was only a small obstacle.

723
01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.300
Yes.

724
01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.170
Why do you insist that I wear shoes?

725
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:54.210
- Of course, what was uncomfortable on your feet?
- Yes I Do.

726
01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:03.230
- What can I ask you something?
- What Are?

727
01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:11.110
Ah, I think I might not be able to go to the party
with you.

728
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:20.050
- Why?
- Because I really can not dance and...

729
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:26.280
I was afraid to spoil the party there.

730
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.260
We need to write our own destiny.

731
01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:41.030
You will come, right?

732
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.210
I will come.

733
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:50.140
- Are your legs numb? Let me see it.
- Yeah.

734
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.240
I would massage her slowly. Do you feel better?

735
01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:07.230
What is your job position?

736
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.030
I ah, a maintenance engineer.

737
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.100
Hey, why did you hit me?
Am I wrong?

738
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:19.240
How do you feel working with a stranger?

739
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:25.180
- What's wrong with you today?
- Be Quiet!

740
01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.050
Come on!

741
01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:36.290
Wait a minute.

742
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.130
Come on!

743
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:30.170
- Are you satisfied?
- Not Yet.

744
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:34.210
- What happened?
- It's none of your business.

745
01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:38.180
Basic strange woman.

746
01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.150
What are you doing here?

747
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:08.240
I stopped for coffee.

748
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.290
What the heck?!

749
01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:26.290
- Did you know?
- Do not let him see me.

750
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.070
- Does he...
- Shut up.

751
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.240
What are you hiding?

752
01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:47.210
As a maintenance engineer,
I believe everything can be fixed...

753
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.190
and make it work again.

754
01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:54.060
No matter how hard it is to
fix it, I will always find a way.

755
01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:01.090
- What?
- Say that last sentence.

756
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.160
You'll be regret if you did not choose me.

757
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.140
It is the last sentence convincing.

758
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:12.250
I think I'm being arrogant with
say it in front of people.

759
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:17.240
No, it's normal. Everyone say
when they promote themselves.

760
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:21.020
Well, let's move on.

761
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.090
When the pressure in the cylinder is abnormally high,
how you fix it?

762
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.260
It's, ah... ah...

763
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.290
Ah, me working under pressure
is quite challenging.

764
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.090
You have to fix it.

765
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.160
Next lesson...

766
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:41.300
How to introduce your skills.
- Is not that the same?

767
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.280
You have to say the pressure with grammar,
so it is understandable.

768
01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.270
Look at the people who were there.

769
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.130
- Is he gone?
- I think he will come in.

770
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:07.170
- Why are you so afraid to meet him?
- He was always bugging me for a date.

771
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.100
So why do not you just turn it down?

772
01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:19.310
Hi.

773
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.140
Look what I brought you.

774
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:31.180
I specifically brought this balloon for you.

775
01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:36.220
- This represents the true love for you.
- Thank you very much.

776
01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:40.260
See, I also bring a lot
food. Let's go inside.

777
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:44.140
Wait, wait... Wait a minute, why are
you so hurry?

778
01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:47.040
I'm hungry, it's time for dinner.

779
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.070
- Ah...
- Let's eat together.

780
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:52.310
I'm not hungry...

781
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.210
Why are you so long?

782
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.180
Who is he?

783
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.050
I'm her co-workers.

784
01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.060
What are you doing?

785
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:08.120
Come on, let's go inside.

786
01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:13.130
Did I disturb you two?

787
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.170
We are in an important conversation.

788
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.270
- He...
- What are you talking about?

789
01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:30.250
You can tell me later.

790
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.260
Okay, let's go back.

791
01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.340
What did you say to him?
What if he commit suicide?

792
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:34.120
- He would not dare.
- I hope not.

793
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.220
I still want to know, what did you tell him?

794
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.120
No, I just tell him you're pregnant.

795
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.220
What? You told him I was pregnant?

796
01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.120
Why do you say that ?!

797
01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:54.120
Are you crazy?
My reputation will be ruined.

798
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:05.140
Bye.

799
01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:13.150
- Tui, Tui, how can I go back?
- Just ride the elevator to the ground floor.

800
01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.280
Bye.

801
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:08.170
- Hello, what's up?
- Where are you?

802
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:11.150
I'm in the coffee shop.

803
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.300
- Why are you still dressed like that?
- I'll change clothes later.

804
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:42.130
What time is it?
Do not you know the party is about to begin?

805
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.170
Do not worry.

806
01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:50.280
- You're going to wear it?
- Yes I Do.

807
01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.190
What is it?
This is the best shirt I have.

808
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:04.090
Hey, do not move.

809
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:08.300
Who taught you how to tie a tie? It's a mess.

810
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:14.140
Oh, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry, are you okay?

811
01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.270
Ah, he's ok.
Don'y worry about it.

812
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:18.300
I'm so sorry.

813
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:26.020
Why did not you answer it?

814
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:30.090
You can not even answer simple
a sentence.

815
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:33.060
- I'm just surprised.
- You keep making excuses.

816
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.290
If you want to master a language,
you should use it.

817
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.030
If necessary, you must
use it every day.

818
01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:44.130
Try to speak only in English
for 3 hours in a day.

819
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:49.180
Oh, why do not you just stab me with a knife?

820
01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.070
It's worth a try.

821
01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.110
Come on, you can do it.

822
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.240
How are you...

823
01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.310
How are you... How are you...

824
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.180

Hey!

826

Why...

827
01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:40.130
Who are you... Who am I?

828
01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.190
- Is this guy ok?
- You think he suffered from Alzheimers?

829
01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:45.100
Are you okay?
You okay?

830
01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:49.130
- I am a maintenance engineer.
- Oh, maintenance engineer.

831

- Congratulations.

832
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:54.180
Yes, congratulations.

834
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.170

- Good luck.

838
01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.190
Really proud.

839
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.190
He thinks I can not speak thai.

840
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:14.030
Do not you know I
born and raised here?

841
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:16.120
Idiot.

842
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.130
- Did you come alone?
- Father.

843
01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.160
Ah, father, mother?

844
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:56.140
My parents were standing right over there.

845
01:22:56.170 --> 01:23:00.270
- Standing...?
- My mother is a lady in a blue dress.

846
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.180
Mother, blue dress...

847
01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:08.240
Which one?

848
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.160
Waw!

849
01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:26.060
Why are you yelling?
Are you afraid?

850
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:32.100
Great.

851
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:38.110
Who taught you that?

852
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.220
Not.

853
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.180
Hey, look at that guy there.

854
01:23:56.130 --> 01:24:00.260

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.230
- He wanted to take her home.

884
01:26:56.210 --> 01:27:00.110
He wants to know how you feel.

I do not know it all happened.

890
01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:35.210
Before it's morning, before the sunrise.

891
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:38.250
Go?

892
01:27:38.290 --> 01:27:45.250
Before I go back to reality.

893
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:47.290
And you...

894
01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:49.220
Before I go back to reality and you...

895
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:55.030
Back in your life.

896
01:27:55.070 --> 01:28:03.140
Tell me you feel the same way too

897
01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:07.140

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:16.240
Because deep inside, I know it's real.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:26.230
I promise, I will forever be yours

902
01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.060
Goodbye, thank you.

903
01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:40.200
Darling open up to me, let me walk you home

904
01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:54.310
Even if you’ll never be mine
I’m in love with you, tonight

905
01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:14.070
Why are you sad at all, what is it?

906
01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:17.080
That's none of your business.

907
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:21.210
What should I say?

908
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:30.020
- June.
- It's very difficult. Why do not you listen again.

909
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.180
Speaking on this tool
like you're crazy.

910
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:37.260
You are crazy! It is a tool for learning.

911
01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:40.290
Basic witless brain useless.

912
01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:46.230
You're rude.

913
01:30:55.150 --> 01:30:57.240
Hello?

914
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:05.090

Current Position: Technician engineer.

919
01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.840
Hey...

920
01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.790
What?

921
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:33.530
Sitting in front.
Do not make any sound. Okay?

922
01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:48.580
Hello, to a friend. How are you?

923
01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.520
Fine, and you?

I'm doing great. Today is the day

925
01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:03.630
- I guess so.
- That's good.

926
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:07.600
Because I need help from you.

927
01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:13.700
I know you can not answer.
It will help pass the interview.

928
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:17.610
So he could come see me.
- What ?

929
01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:24.490
- Say that again? - Tell him to
remember the name of the company founder.

930
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.660
What is the intention of change decision?

931
01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:37.500
You've been refusing to speak
to this person all the time.

932
01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.630
I just changed my mind.

933
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:42.540
Why are you talking funny?

934
01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:48.550
Oh, now, I'm in the middle
translate some large documents.

935
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:50.710
All vocabs definitely mixed.

936
01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:56.520
- I see.
- So about mr. golden retriever?

937
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:59.520
He will away for 3 months.

938
01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.680
We have an open relationship.

939
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:06.690
So I can see anybody I like.

940
01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:11.700
So, when he returned,
what will happen to Jim?

941
01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:15.700
Why do you sound concern?

942
01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.480
I'm just curious.

943
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:30.520
- What?
- Oh, My God.

944
01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.450
You love Jim.

945
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:40.690
Oh My God. Oh My God.
You guys had sex.

946
01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:42.700
Hell no!

947
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.540
Stop it!

948
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:55.580
To friends, be careful, you're going to get hurt.

949
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:59.450
Be ready to be broken heart.

950
01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:14.460
What is real?

951
01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:19.470
Oh, I guess yes.

952
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.480
Forget it.

953
01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:36.520
I understand the words ahe utters,
you love Jim.

954
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.730
What if it is true?

955
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.650
You're not supposed to love people like me.

956
01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:17.560
True.

957
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:22.730
Maybe it was just feeling a little while.

958
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:43.580
I do not want to spoil your mission.

959
01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:58.730
I would love to work again.

960
01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:04.600
I will always be fit for it.

961
01:37:04.710 --> 01:37:07.470
1 minute speech.

962
01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.670
Let's see who's turn.

963
01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.590
Fairy Tale

964
01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:35.530
Once upon a time, a little girl
dream to become a princess ..

965
01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:35.620
And meeting a charming prince who will love her
.

966
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:44.680
In the real world, a princess
may not want a prince charming.

967
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:48.610
But dust and ordinary shoemaker.

968
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:54.720
And it is not a prince charming fault.
He knows what's funny.

969
01:37:55.690 --> 01:38:01.600
In the end to anyone who knows the shoemakers
may not want a princess either.

970
01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:09.510
Therefore, that is not necessary for the story
to ended with happilyever after.

971
01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:18.610
It was a good story.

972
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:26.650
- It is sad.
- It's just a story. So mediocre.

973
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:35.690
Is it like a real story?

974
01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:39.640
Oh ..

975
01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:43.670
might be similar.

976
01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.610
But I guess it's just a story.

977
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:59.690
What about your own heart to speak?

978
01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.650
Are you willing?

979
01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:11.590
I certainly can.

980
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:26.710
I will always be here for you.

981
01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:32.650
- Thank you.
- For you, I will always be there.

982
01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.490
I'm really flattered once.

983
01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:45.600
You should not be sad.

984
01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:55.550
Yes.

985
01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:06.550

No problem. I'm a professional.

This is the nature of the work that normally
we high pressure situations.

01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:14.690
- Do you think you can handle this?

996
01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:24.720
I've done a lot of work in high-pressure job.

997
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:35.500
For me to working under pressure
quite challenging.

998
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:38.570

- What would do i think?
- Yeah.

1002
01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:56.560
I think you're trying to illustrate how you feel about it.

1003
01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:02.500
Ah, working on high pressure machine is
dangerous, but you're up to the challenge, right?

1004
01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.540

Why should we choose you,
what are your strong point?

As a maintenance engineer, I believe everything
can be fixed and to work again.

1007
01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.680
No matter how hard it is to fix.
I will always find a way.

1008
01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:32.690
You'll regret if you don't choose me.

1009
01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:42.670
- You'll be sorry if you do not choose me.
- Well, thank you for participating.

1010
01:43:42.710 --> 01:43:44.500

1011
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.580
- I have one last question.
- Yeah.

1012
01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:30.520
What is the name of our company founder?

1013
01:44:35.530 --> 01:44:38.500

1017
01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:20.470
What is the name of our company founder?

1018
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:24.630
Doraemon.

1019
01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:34.680
I think I missed the point.
But I do not regret it.

1020
01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:43.690
For what I'm going to leave
something important.

1021
01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:50.560
Over all that is always with me.

1022
01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:55.500
I know I'm stupid.

1023
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:59.700
So I guess I don't deserve it.

1024
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:06.710
I have feelings for you.

1025
01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:12.550
Although it's difficult.

1026
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:50.690
Why are you going to cry?

1027
01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:56.690
It would be very embarrassing.

1028
01:46:57.670 --> 01:47:01.730
- It's crowded.
- Do they dare speak to me?

1029
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:07.510
Yes.

1030
01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:12.680
This is the first time we met.

1031
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.510
In a place where you taught me well.

1032
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:25.560
I always thought of this.

1033
01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:36.600
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

1034
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:44.480
Don't cry.

1035
01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:51.450
The earphone, give it to me.

1036
01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:15.510
As a maintenance engineer, I believe,
everything can be fixed and work again.

1037
01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:21.640
No matter how hard it is to fix.
I'll always find a way.

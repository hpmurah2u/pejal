1
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.333
Seven heavens call upon its name.

2
00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:41.208
Seven lands tremble at its fame.

3
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.541
The sacred kris is shrouded in mystery.

4
00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:49.833
Thought to be lost for all eternity.

5
00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:55.166
Centuries pass with nary a whisper.

6
00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:59.625
A mystical secret for one to discover.

7
00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:56.125
Inderaloka belongs to me…

8
00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.875
Raja Bersiong!

9
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.708
You won't… get away… with this.

10
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.333
The chosen ones will return.

11
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:18.041
The Lone Gibbon Kris will awaken.

12
00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:22.375
Tears will reveal your true identity.

13
00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.750
Lone Gibb--

14
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.708
Get that kris now!

15
00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.333
Upin, hurry!

16
00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.125
Run, Upin! Run!

17
00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:05.750
There he is!

18
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:09.166
BOTTLES

19
00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:13.083
Rembo!

20
00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:15.833
Rembo, wait!

21
00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.333
Rembo!

22
00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.208
We'll get you!

23
00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.000
Why do you always steal my shoe?

24
00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:43.458
Don't you have other shoes to steal?

25
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.416
Hey! Don't get so mad at him.

26
00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:47.875
He's just a chicken.

27
00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:50.416
Well, next time, he'll be cooked.

28
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:56.083
Let's find Atok.

29
00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.458
-Atok!
-Atok!

30
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.333
-Oh!
-Atok?

31
00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:07.458
Atok.

32
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.458
Let's go.

33
00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:21.125
Don't do that, Tok!

34
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.125
What if we had a heart attack?

35
00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:26.333
Heart attack?
You kids are too young for that.

36
00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.916
Disgusting.

37
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:41.083
Reminds me of our room!

38
00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.958
That's why I asked you to help me.

39
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:49.166
You two, clean up over there.

40
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.125
What's this?

41
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.750
Wow, so many krises!

42
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.458
Be careful with that!

43
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.708
It's sharp!

44
00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:28.333
I know.

45
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.875
Where did you get all these cool things?

46
00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:36.625
It's my secret stash.

47
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:40.333
They're all family heirlooms

48
00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.125
passed down from my ancestors.

49
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:49.083
See this one, right here?

50
00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:50.708
This is from Ah Tong.

51
00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.500
Uncle Ah Tong had a kris?

52
00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:54.166
Where did he get that?

53
00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:57.458
Some guy sold it to him,
so, of course, he bought it.

54
00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:01.750
You know, I've got a really strange kris.

55
00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:04.333
An old man gave it to me.

56
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.625
He called it the Lone Gibbon Kris.

57
00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.958
The Lone Gibbon?

58
00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:13.708
Legend has it--

59
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:15.708
‪Scoot!‬

60
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:20.250
Ouch!

61
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:23.625
Watch it, chicken!

62
00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.125
No. Not my good shirt.

63
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.208
That's poop.

64
00:07:34.083 --> 00:07:35.791
Hey, that's enough.

65
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.791
You two get back to cleaning this shed.

66
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.875
And don't touch anything else.

67
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:40.875
Okay?

68
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.708
-Yes, boss!
-Darn kids.

69
00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:55.583
-Upin! Ipin!
-In here.

70
00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.333
Yeah. Ehsan's got a new phone.

71
00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.041
What's going on in here?

72
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:05.750
We were supposed to play ball!

73
00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.375
Stay and help us clean, then.

74
00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:13.708
For sure! Besides, we can play clean up!

75
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.625
Hey! Mail, don't even think about it!

76
00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:19.750
Fine. I'll stay.

77
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:30.000
Guys, right here!

78
00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:32.416
-Jarjit!
-Upin!

79
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.375
Out of the way!

80
00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:43.125
Stop playing around!

81
00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:48.333
Mei Mei! Susanti!

82
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.291
Here!

83
00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:57.666
I'm Captain Ipin!

84
00:08:58.416 --> 00:09:01.333
Feel the power of the Lone Gibbon Kris!

85
00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.666
But how did it move by itself?

86
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:11.541
Why is the picture blurry?

87
00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:12.875
What's inside that thing?

88
00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:17.750
A five-eyed monster with teeth.

89
00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:41.125
It's kind of small.

90
00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:44.458
Is this the Lone Gibbon Kris
Tok was talking about?

91
00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:48.125
A magic kris?

92
00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:50.750
I could sell it and be rich!

93
00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:54.375
Mail, nobody is going to sell it.

94
00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.708
Because it's not yours.

95
00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.375
Go. Yeah. Get it.

96
00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.916
Heavy.

97
00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:21.916
What? What a wimp!

98
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.166
Yeah. Come on, Mail.

99
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.708
I bet we could do it!

100
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.500
Oh! Careful.

101
00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:34.041
And one, two, three!

102
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:37.666
-I can't believe it!
-How did they do it?

103
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.541
Awesome!

104
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.958
It's so light.

105
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:51.166
-Hey, Mail, what's wrong?
-Are you okay?

106
00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.458
-Awesome shots!
-I think my shoe slipped.

107
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:58.333
Wait. What's this?

108
00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:01.458
Upin, Ipin, look at this.

109
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:02.958
-What is it?
-Look here!

110
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:11.458
"When stars of two shine so bright,

111
00:11:12.708 --> 00:11:18.458
darkness soon will turn to light."

112
00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.541
It's floating!

113
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.250
Where's the blade?

114
00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:45.458
What's happening?

115
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.916
Upin.

116
00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:55.666
Ipin!

117
00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:12.625
Don't let go!

118
00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:16.625
Upin.

119
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:19.833
Ipin!

120
00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:14.458
My head.

121
00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:22.750
Where are we?

122
00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:02.791
I have to get that magical hair.
Let's see.

123
00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:05.708
One strand equals ten gold pieces.

124
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.958
Two strands are 20 gold pieces.

125
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:12.208
Three strands, that's 30 gold pieces.

126
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.250
Eight strands…

127
00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.291
Eighty gold pieces.

128
00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:23.958
Nine strands, 90 gold pieces.

129
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:27.250
Ten strands…

130
00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:30.583
Wow!

131
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.583
Rich! I'll be super rich!

132
00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:40.583
And I can marry the princess!

133
00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:44.125
I've got to get that hair now!

134
00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:51.625
What?

135
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.083
Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup!

136
00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:06.791
Hair?

137
00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.333
Jackpot!

138
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.208
Must… be… rich.

139
00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:28.041
Gotta… get… that… hair.

140
00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.125
Ouch!

141
00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:47.833
Jarjit!

142
00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.458
Run away!

143
00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.000
Run, Ehsan!

144
00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.583
Wait for me!

145
00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:19.916
What was that scary glowing thing?

146
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:23.541
Help me!

147
00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:26.666
Mei Mei!

148
00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:29.083
‪Come on. I'll get you down.‬

149
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.916
That's Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup.

150
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.250
It eats people!

151
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.583
Everybody in Inderaloka knows that.

152
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:40.708
Inderaloka?

153
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.625
Yeah. Inderaloka.

154
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:47.708
Welcome to the kingdom
of the beautiful skies

155
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.666
and heavenly earth.

156
00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:55.875
Where on earth are we?

157
00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958
We're lost!

158
00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:01.416
Wait, we can use this!

159
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.333
Come on.

160
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.833
Unable to find location?

161
00:17:16.083 --> 00:17:17.540
Daddy!

162
00:17:19.165 --> 00:17:20.790
Help us, Tall Guy!

163
00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:21.833
Hey!

164
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.458
Help!

165
00:17:27.208 --> 00:17:28.290
Daddy!

166
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:31.875
We'll find the way back together.

167
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.958
Hey!

168
00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:37.750
Daddy!

169
00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:39.791
What are we going to do, Ipin?

170
00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.125
Ipin?

171
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:44.750
Where's Ipin?

172
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.916
-Ipin!
-Where is he?

173
00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:52.125
Ipin!

174
00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:54.958
Ipin?

175
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.916
Ipin.

176
00:17:57.833 --> 00:18:00.125
-Hey! Where are you?
-Ipin!

177
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.000
Upin?

178
00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:12.458
Ipin, what's wrong?

179
00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:15.208
Nothing.

180
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.875
It's so pretty!

181
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.166
Susanti! Hurry up.

182
00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:29.083
-Come on!
-Wait for me!

183
00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.916
Ehsan! Upin!

184
00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:36.750
Where are you?

185
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.916
Ehsan!

186
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:46.333
Where is everybody?

187
00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:51.583
Yeah, I'm getting really tired.

188
00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:54.583
Just keep walking.

189
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.333
Bunch of babies.

190
00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.083
It's got four wings!

191
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.833
I bet it's worth a lot!

192
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.875
One, two, three!

193
00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:53.416
Here, look!

194
00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.750
It's Atok's kris!

195
00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:13.500
Run!

196
00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.000
Come on!

197
00:21:59.916 --> 00:22:02.833
-Thanks for saving--
-That'll be two gold pieces!

198
00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:07.083
We have to pay you?

199
00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:11.375
Yeah! Don't you know
how dangerous Reriangs are?

200
00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:13.958
If we get caught, we're done for!

201
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.083
Wait up!

202
00:22:22.125 --> 00:22:24.083
Why were they chasing you guys?

203
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.000
I don't know.

204
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:34.458
What are you looking at me for?

205
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.333
We got lost.

206
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.083
We'll never find our way back home.

207
00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:43.208
It's okay, Fizi. We'll find our way out.
Somehow.

208
00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:46.208
Who is this guy?

209
00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:58.083
-It's getting dark.
-Oh no. What's that?

210
00:22:58.541 --> 00:22:59.416
Come with me.

211
00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:18.708
I can't stand it anymore!

212
00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:21.083
I can feel its return!

213
00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:22.791
It's come back!

214
00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:27.375
Who dares to bring the kris
back into my kingdom?

215
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.083
The kingdom of Siong!

216
00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:49.708
Seer!

217
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:51.625
My Lord, please don't hurt me.

218
00:23:51.708 --> 00:23:55.791
The Lone… Gibbon. It's here.

219
00:23:57.333 --> 00:23:59.250
The Lone Gibbon?

220
00:24:00.083 --> 00:24:04.208
That dagger! That cursed kris!

221
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.000
Oh! Yes, kris, yes.

222
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.791
But it's impossible!

223
00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:14.291
I've locked up all the entrances
to the kingdom. You must believe.

224
00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:19.625
I felt its power
shake the ground yesterday!

225
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:24.250
I think that the Batu Belah
might be responsible.

226
00:24:24.333 --> 00:24:26.250
Impossible, my lord.

227
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.291
Only I know how to open it.

228
00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:33.666
Get out of my sight!

229
00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:45.041
You better find that kris. Now, go.

230
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.000
Forgive me, my lord!

231
00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:50.875
But I don't really know where to start.

232
00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:58.708
But aren't you the best soothsayer
in all of Inderaloka?

233
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:02.750
The famous Pak Belalang?

234
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:06.000
It should be no problem for you.

235
00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:07.583
Find it now!

236
00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:13.791
But… I need my all-seeing bowl.

237
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:17.083
If you would just allow me
to go home and fetch it.

238
00:26:14.416 --> 00:26:16.583
Go on. Drink. What are you waiting for?

239
00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:27.375
Good, huh?

240
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.708
-Yummy!
-Drink up!

241
00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:31.875
Belalang!

242
00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:32.958
Papa?

243
00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:37.125
Belalang!

244
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.208
Belalang!

245
00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:42.250
This is it, Belalang!

246
00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:44.458
We're completely done for!

247
00:26:44.541 --> 00:26:45.666
We have to--

248
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.458
Hi!

249
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.583
Who are you?

250
00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:52.708
I'm Fizi. These are--

251
00:26:52.791 --> 00:26:55.375
Belalang, who are these children?

252
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:57.458
We have to get them out of here!

253
00:26:58.041 --> 00:26:59.541
They got lost, Papa.

254
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:01.166
Poor kids.

255
00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:03.541
I found them and helped them out.

256
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:05.208
Are you angry?

257
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:08.625
Oh, no.

258
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.833
But we have to get out of here right now!
Hurry! Pack up.

259
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:29.583
Where did you get that?

260
00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:32.083
It's Atok's kris. We found it.

261
00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:34.458
But its blade is just gone.

262
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.666
Where's the sheath?

263
00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:41.125
I don't know! It's gone!

264
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.750
-Oh, I can't believe this.
-Ouch.

265
00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:49.250
Oh, come on. It's all this kris' fault!

266
00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:56.916
How did you--?

267
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.041
Weird.

268
00:27:58.125 --> 00:27:59.916
How come only you and Upin can lift it?

269
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.166
There's another one?

270
00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:06.458
Because we're super special!

271
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.500
Right?

272
00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:09.500
Upin.

273
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:12.708
Then the prophecy is true!

274
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:13.958
You're the--

275
00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:24.583
They're coming!

276
00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:27.250
Hurry. Follow me!

277
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:29.625
Quickly. Over here.

278
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.833
A secret passage?

279
00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.041
Hurry. Get in!

280
00:28:40.125 --> 00:28:41.666
No! It's dark!

281
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.791
Get in!

282
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.875
They're here!

283
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:46.333
What's that sound?

284
00:28:49.708 --> 00:28:52.250
Son! Protect the boy with the kris.

285
00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:54.333
And find Nakhoda Ragam!

286
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.666
And stay away from men
with burn scars on their ears!

287
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.208
Papa?

288
00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:26.083
Where are we?

289
00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:30.041
This is where it goes?

290
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:36.250
Bananas for sale!

291
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:37.875
‪I want those. And those.‬

292
00:29:37.958 --> 00:29:40.208
Two for one special. Come and get it.

293
00:29:40.333 --> 00:29:42.291
‪Hey. Good day, madam.‬

294
00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:43.666
Care for some fish?

295
00:29:58.291 --> 00:30:00.791
Nakhoda Ragam has to be here.

296
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:02.583
Come on!

297
00:30:02.791 --> 00:30:03.958
Do we have to?

298
00:30:04.041 --> 00:30:05.583
What for?

299
00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:07.125
Just follow him.

300
00:30:07.375 --> 00:30:11.125
MEGAH HARBOR

301
00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:15.458
What a beautiful sheath.

302
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.208
Have I seen it somewhere before?

303
00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.958
It looks like it could be…

304
00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:22.958
Nah, I couldn't have seen--

305
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:24.291
Tall Guy!

306
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tall Guy?

307
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.708
He looks funny.

308
00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:39.875
You brats again.

309
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.333
Hey. It's Atok's kris!

310
00:30:43.333 --> 00:30:44.458
Hey! That belongs to me.

311
00:30:44.541 --> 00:30:45.875
No, it's Atok's! Give it back.

312
00:30:46.083 --> 00:30:47.541
I don't care.

313
00:30:47.916 --> 00:30:49.583
Hey!

314
00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:52.708
This thing's worth some cash!

315
00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:55.333
With that cash, I'll buy some chickens.

316
00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:56.750
Then I can take the chickens

317
00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:59.958
and exchange them for a big old cow!

318
00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:03.041
Then, after I sell that cow…

319
00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:05.625
I'll be rich!

320
00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:09.291
And I'll finally marry
the king's daughter!

321
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.041
-Genius!
-Mister!

322
00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:15.000
You sure do daydream a lot.

323
00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:16.500
You're like Mat Jenin.

324
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:19.125
Hey! You're a really smart girl.

325
00:31:19.208 --> 00:31:23.416
That's because I am Mat Jenin,
you're friendly neighborhood daydreamer!

326
00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:27.375
But they're not just dreams,
oh no! They're goals!

327
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:30.833
Dream your future, and it will arrive!

328
00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:32.875
Enough. I'm getting some food.

329
00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:33.958
Food?

330
00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:35.166
I'm getting hungry.

331
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:37.666
Are we there yet?

332
00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:48.375
Here we are!

333
00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:52.875
MAK DERUMA'S SMOKED BANANAS

334
00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:12.333
You're so adorable!

335
00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:14.125
Are you hungry?

336
00:32:14.208 --> 00:32:15.500
-Want some smoked bananas?
-Yeah!

337
00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:22.875
Two, three--

338
00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:26.250
Two, three smoked bananas.

339
00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:28.041
Com! Have some bananas!

340
00:32:28.125 --> 00:32:31.250
-The bananas are here!
-The bananas are here!

341
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.208
I smell bananas!

342
00:32:42.708 --> 00:32:45.041
Mak Deruma, how have you been?

343
00:32:48.458 --> 00:32:51.916
I get it, Mak Deruma. I owe you--

344
00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:54.791
I'll pay you back.

345
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.166
Everybody, listen up!

346
00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:21.458
All these bananas…

347
00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:26.083
belong to Mek Min!

348
00:33:30.666 --> 00:33:32.166
Stop the squawk.

349
00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:35.375
Wow! So cool!

350
00:33:35.458 --> 00:33:37.666
I like her! Tell me. Who is she?

351
00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:39.750
The pirate queen.

352
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:47.750
What's Mak Deruma looking at?

353
00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:52.000
Oh. She's looking at
that stone statue of her boy.

354
00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:55.083
She cursed her own son into stone.

355
00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.166
Why?

356
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.625
Her son Tanggang betrayed her.

357
00:33:58.708 --> 00:34:01.666
He told Mak Der that she's not his mother.

358
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:04.041
Don't you kids be like that.

359
00:34:05.166 --> 00:34:07.958
I bet she still misses him.

360
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:12.291
She opened this place
and only serves smoked bananas

361
00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:13.875
because Tanggang loved them.

362
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.083
Mak?

363
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:30.833
Do you want a smoked banana?

364
00:34:30.916 --> 00:34:32.291
We can share it!

365
00:34:32.666 --> 00:34:34.291
We can share it, Mom.

366
00:34:35.583 --> 00:34:37.250
Tanggang.

367
00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:44.458
That's your son, isn't it?

368
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.041
The curse, how did you do it?

369
00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:54.500
Mak, don't be sad.

370
00:34:58.083 --> 00:35:02.000
I acted so rashly toward him.

371
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:07.708
I didn't know what to do.

372
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:10.750
I should have forgiven him.

373
00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:15.250
So, do you forgive him now?

374
00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:27.250
Tanggang.

375
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.458
I'd forgiven you long ago, my son,

376
00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:38.791
but I couldn't say it

377
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:42.625
until now. I'm a forged woman.

378
00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:48.666
I forgive you, Tanggang.

379
00:36:33.208 --> 00:36:35.666
I forgive you.

380
00:36:53.833 --> 00:36:55.375
Hey, look at this!

381
00:36:56.125 --> 00:36:57.625
Look!

382
00:37:09.083 --> 00:37:12.541
See? I knew it! It's a mystical kris!

383
00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:16.458
There are some words here.

384
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.958
"Two souls--"

385
00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:25.541
Let's go see!

386
00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:28.416
You guys!

387
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:31.416
Wait for me!

388
00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:44.916
Hey! Want to see something really neat?

389
00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:47.083
Behold!

390
00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:50.666
This is a magical kris that's invisible!

391
00:37:51.041 --> 00:37:52.250
Invisible?

392
00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:54.500
Nah! I bet it's a scam.

393
00:37:55.791 --> 00:37:57.333
I swear I'm not lying.

394
00:37:57.458 --> 00:38:01.958
This kris has a blade
that's invisible but very sharp.

395
00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:09.166
Only the chosen ones are able to see it!

396
00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:11.291
Here, come on. I'll show you!

397
00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.916
The early bird gets the worm!

398
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.375
It's for sale! So?

399
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:15.666
What's going on?

400
00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:17.333
Hey! That's Atok's kris!

401
00:38:17.416 --> 00:38:19.708
It can be yours.
That is, for the right price!

402
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:21.750
-Give it back!
-Hey!

403
00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:31.416
Get away! It's mine! Give it here.

404
00:38:40.208 --> 00:38:41.041
‪Why can't he pick it up?‬

405
00:38:48.416 --> 00:38:49.750
The Lone Gibbon?

406
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.166
Stop!

407
00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.208
Which one of you is the chosen one?

408
00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:06.958
Mak Der.

409
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.708
They've got to get out of here now.

410
00:39:30.333 --> 00:39:32.083
Swordfish!

411
00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:34.875
The island is under attack!

412
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:36.625
Listen here!

413
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:38.333
Defend our territory!

414
00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:40.541
Pirates, do not let them in!

415
00:39:44.458 --> 00:39:45.375
They're coming!

416
00:39:46.875 --> 00:39:49.041
Stop that! There's an opening over there!

417
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:50.458
You! Go help!

418
00:39:51.083 --> 00:39:52.708
Go! Now! Get to the harbor!

419
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:53.833
-But--
-Run!

420
00:39:53.916 --> 00:39:55.000
Don't worry.

421
00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:56.291
Go!

422
00:39:56.416 --> 00:39:58.166
-Here they come!
-Mak!

423
00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:00.333
-Go!
-Are you okay?

424
00:40:00.958 --> 00:40:01.791
‪Watch out!‬

425
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:03.458
‪Take cover!‬

426
00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:06.916
-Mak!
-Take cover. Now!

427
00:40:07.333 --> 00:40:10.791
-The chosen one will return someday.
-This way. Over here.

428
00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.208
‪Over here. Take cover.‬

429
00:40:27.416 --> 00:40:28.708
Steady, men!

430
00:40:34.958 --> 00:40:36.250
Mak!

431
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.291
Mak!

432
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.083
So, I was right.

433
00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:52.458
The kris has returned.

434
00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:54.708
Re!

435
00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.250
Ri!

436
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:57.500
Ang!

437
00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:01.041
Destroy them all!

438
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.250
And bring the kris to me.

439
00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:14.416
I, Raja Bersiong,

440
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.875
will prove that the prophecy
won't come true!

441
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.750
Come on. Let's go.

442
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.666
-We don't want to miss the show.
-We're going to miss the show.

443
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:50.375
‪-Come on.‬
‪-We're going to be late.‬

444
00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:56.291
‪Oh, wow!‬

445
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:06.583
Seven heavens

446
00:42:08.416 --> 00:42:13.000
Call upon its name

447
00:42:15.875 --> 00:42:19.791
Seven lands

448
00:42:20.416 --> 00:42:24.458
Tremble at its fame

449
00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:31.125
The sacred kris with the nation's dreams

450
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:36.166
The sacred kris with the power of kings

451
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:43.333
Lost from the world for eternity

452
00:42:43.416 --> 00:42:49.208
Centuries go by, passing like a breeze

453
00:42:56.083 --> 00:42:59.666
It patiently awaits

454
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:05.291
To be discovered

455
00:43:39.916 --> 00:43:41.041
Come on.

456
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:49.208
The kris will aid the one that's true

457
00:43:49.416 --> 00:43:52.000
To deliver the traitors their due

458
00:43:52.083 --> 00:43:54.916
Who is this one, our champion of heroes?

459
00:43:55.125 --> 00:43:58.875
Who will rise and bring prosperity?

460
00:44:03.333 --> 00:44:06.125
Seven heavens call upon its name

461
00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:09.083
Seven lands tremble at its fame

462
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:11.875
The sacred kris with the power of kings

463
00:44:11.958 --> 00:44:16.250
The sacred kris gives the nation
Hope to sing

464
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:23.041
Be not one to wander, lost in tragedy

465
00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:28.791
The crown's fallen, the kingdom in defeat

466
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:34.291
Rise up to the throne now
Set your people free

467
00:44:34.791 --> 00:44:40.416
Tears will reveal your true identity

468
00:44:41.625 --> 00:44:44.291
Seven heavens call upon its name

469
00:44:44.416 --> 00:44:47.000
Seven lands tremble at its fame

470
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:50.000
The sacred kris with the power of kings

471
00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:55.791
The sacred kris gives the nation
Hope to sing

472
00:44:55.875 --> 00:45:01.125
Be not one to wander, lost in tragedy

473
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:06.458
-The crown's fallen, the kingdom in defeat
-Ipin!

474
00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:12.583
Rise up to the throne now
Set your people free

475
00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:18.291
Tears will reveal your true identity

476
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.125
Ipin!

477
00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:42.541
Upin?

478
00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:45.416
Ipin.

479
00:45:49.708 --> 00:45:50.583
Upin!

480
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:51.791
Ipin!

481
00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:17.208
Be no wanderer, lost in tragedy

482
00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:22.166
Rise up to the throne
Set your people free

483
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.250
Sing it!

484
00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:28.833
Be no wanderer, lost in tragedy

485
00:46:28.916 --> 00:46:34.041
Rise up to the throne
Set your people free

486
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:39.791
Be no wanderer, lost in tragedy

487
00:46:39.875 --> 00:46:45.000
Rise up to the throne
Set your people free

488
00:46:45.083 --> 00:46:50.083
Be no wanderer, lost in tragedy

489
00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:54.291
Rise up to the throne
Set your people free

490
00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:02.166
Hey, you followed me.

491
00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:04.666
Of course, Ipin! We're twins.

492
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.583
And twins stick together.

493
00:47:08.833 --> 00:47:10.458
Oh, wow. The sheath!

494
00:47:10.833 --> 00:47:12.583
Oh! I've got the kris.

495
00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:14.958
And look! I have the blade.

496
00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:17.250
Whoa! How did you--?

497
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.541
Who's that?

498
00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:26.625
It's the men
with burn scars on their ears.

499
00:47:27.958 --> 00:47:29.500
Hand me that kris.

500
00:47:29.875 --> 00:47:30.875
No way!

501
00:47:30.958 --> 00:47:32.375
Who are you?

502
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:41.000
What happened?

503
00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:43.416
Run! Come on. Let's go.

504
00:47:45.416 --> 00:47:46.666
Ipin, help!

505
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.083
-Belalang!
-Wait!

506
00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:50.958
Let go!

507
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.708
Go! Run. Save yourselves!

508
00:47:52.791 --> 00:47:53.875
Hurry.

509
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:15.125
Come on. Hurry.

510
00:48:18.083 --> 00:48:20.541
Two, three insects fly.
I'm too young to die!

511
00:48:24.416 --> 00:48:25.666
Help!

512
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:26.833
Susanti!

513
00:48:30.291 --> 00:48:31.416
Daddy!

514
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.125
Where's everyone?

515
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:38.500
Where are we?

516
00:48:38.583 --> 00:48:39.791
Oh no!

517
00:48:46.416 --> 00:48:47.833
Run, Ipin!

518
00:48:54.666 --> 00:48:55.958
Hurry!

519
00:49:02.958 --> 00:49:04.458
Got you!

520
00:49:06.416 --> 00:49:07.625
Look out!

521
00:49:28.083 --> 00:49:29.208
Yay! We did it.

522
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:30.333
Upin, look!

523
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.750
I think we better run.

524
00:49:49.791 --> 00:49:50.916
Pathetic!

525
00:50:32.958 --> 00:50:34.000
Hey! Come on.

526
00:50:35.083 --> 00:50:35.916
‪Yeah.‬

527
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.333
Wait up.

528
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:01.000
Take that!

529
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:03.416
No. Get away.

530
00:51:08.041 --> 00:51:09.666
Ipin, look!

531
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:49.333
Upin! Ipin!

532
00:51:49.416 --> 00:51:50.750
Over here. Let's go.

533
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:08.666
Come on.

534
00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:29.541
Ipin.

535
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.208
The Lone Gibbon Kris?

536
00:53:07.416 --> 00:53:09.250
Yay! We did it!

537
00:53:13.375 --> 00:53:15.750
Don't forget we have all your friends.

538
00:53:16.875 --> 00:53:18.875
-Help!
-Help me!

539
00:53:18.958 --> 00:53:20.458
-No!
-My friends!

540
00:53:21.791 --> 00:53:24.750
Bring the kris
to the castle of Raja Bersiong.

541
00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:26.875
Do it or else…

542
00:53:45.875 --> 00:53:47.333
Just give them the kris!

543
00:53:47.416 --> 00:53:48.500
-We can't!
-We can't!

544
00:53:52.875 --> 00:53:55.083
If the kris falls into the wrong hands,

545
00:53:55.166 --> 00:53:56.833
Inderaloka is doomed!

546
00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.000
But our friends are in trouble and--

547
00:53:59.083 --> 00:54:00.791
No. Your friends are safe for now.

548
00:54:01.583 --> 00:54:04.041
As long as we have this,
they can't be hurt.

549
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:07.250
I don't care about that.
I want to make sure they're safe.

550
00:54:07.333 --> 00:54:08.666
Yeah. Upin's right.

551
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.666
And after that, we can go home.

552
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.250
Because here, people turn into insects.

553
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:15.625
It's evil. It's so scary.

554
00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:16.791
Hey. Don't be scared.

555
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:18.666
I'm your friend. Remember?

556
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.250
I'll be able to help you.

557
00:54:24.208 --> 00:54:27.083
With our strength,
we're taking Raja Bersiong.

558
00:54:28.958 --> 00:54:31.500
-Wow!
-Yes! To the castle of Raja Bersiong.

559
00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:34.708
But wait. Where is it?

560
00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:38.500
There's one way to get there, rascal.
I know a shortcut.

561
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.083
But how could you know that?

562
00:54:42.416 --> 00:54:43.583
Who are you?

563
00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:52.500
Who are you?

564
00:55:01.625 --> 00:55:04.708
The ship sails across the ocean blue

565
00:55:05.916 --> 00:55:09.875
The gambus in tune and the song is true

566
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:14.958
The music plays, and the sea is calm

567
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.250
I am…

568
00:55:20.416 --> 00:55:23.541
I am Nakhoda Ragam!

569
00:55:28.208 --> 00:55:29.583
Nakhoda Ragam?

570
00:55:32.375 --> 00:55:34.166
Hey. I was told to look for you.

571
00:55:34.833 --> 00:55:36.291
By my father.

572
00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:39.458
So you're the son of Pak Belalang.

573
00:55:39.958 --> 00:55:44.166
That means he must have known
about the kris already. He must have.

574
00:55:44.416 --> 00:55:46.375
Yeah, he knows, for sure.

575
00:55:46.708 --> 00:55:48.708
And he told me to take care of him.

576
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:51.500
"When stars of two shine so bright,

577
00:55:52.083 --> 00:55:54.833
darkness soon will turn to light."

578
00:55:57.041 --> 00:56:00.916
"Two souls will guide the way…"

579
00:56:03.625 --> 00:56:04.666
Say what?

580
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:05.750
In that case…

581
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.750
Set sail to the Island of Delights.

582
00:56:18.916 --> 00:56:21.250
Look how far we've gotten already.

583
00:56:21.625 --> 00:56:23.708
Ipin! What's that?

584
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.333
What's what?

585
00:56:31.583 --> 00:56:33.250
Wow. So cute.

586
00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:43.750
Hey! Give it back!

587
00:56:44.875 --> 00:56:46.291
My shoe!

588
00:56:53.541 --> 00:56:54.500
Here.

589
00:56:56.583 --> 00:56:57.541
Here.

590
00:56:58.583 --> 00:56:59.625
Upin? Ipin?

591
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:01.500
Oh. They're gone!

592
00:57:15.625 --> 00:57:18.208
Hey! Those trees look like kebabs,
don't you think?

593
00:57:18.666 --> 00:57:21.416
-And look at all the tortoises!
-Wow!

594
00:57:42.541 --> 00:57:43.708
Get back here!

595
00:57:44.083 --> 00:57:45.750
Almost got it, Upin!

596
00:57:57.583 --> 00:58:00.125
Everybody always wants to steal my shoe!

597
00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:04.000
Where's that singing coming from?

598
00:58:26.791 --> 00:58:27.958
Upin!

599
00:58:29.666 --> 00:58:31.000
It's like milk!

600
00:58:39.333 --> 00:58:40.666
Upin, look at that!

601
00:58:41.666 --> 00:58:42.666
Come on!

602
00:58:50.166 --> 00:58:51.000
‪Wow!‬

603
00:58:52.208 --> 00:58:54.625
It's so pretty!

604
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.166
It looks just like home.

605
00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:17.250
I really miss Opah and Kak Ros.

606
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.083
Me, too.

607
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.666
-Upin! Ipin!
-Opah?

608
00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:32.041
Upin. Ipin.

609
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.375
Come home.

610
00:59:34.833 --> 00:59:37.041
We miss you so much.

611
00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:41.125
Well, come on.
I've even made fried chicken.

612
00:59:41.291 --> 00:59:42.458
Come home.

613
00:59:45.958 --> 00:59:47.375
Come home.

614
00:59:49.458 --> 00:59:51.708
-Opah!
-Upin, Ipin, come back to us.

615
00:59:52.833 --> 00:59:54.250
Opah!

616
00:59:54.333 --> 00:59:55.291
Akak!

617
00:59:55.666 --> 00:59:56.916
Take my hand.

618
00:59:58.416 --> 00:59:59.333
Opah!

619
01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:16.833
There's that singing again.

620
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:29.416
Swinging slow and free

621
01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:32.791
-As the wind calls to me
-Ipin, look!

622
01:00:33.916 --> 01:00:40.125
Swinging to the sighings of my heart

623
01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:44.833
Swinging slow and free

624
01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:48.541
As the wind calls to me

625
01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:54.583
My heart breaks from this reality

626
01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:21.666
Belalang!

627
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:22.875
Upin, Ipin!

628
01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:24.458
Where have you guys been?

629
01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:26.041
We've been looking everywhere!

630
01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:27.458
I guess we got lost.

631
01:01:27.541 --> 01:01:28.708
May I ask who you are?

632
01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:30.916
And how did you find your way
into this cave?

633
01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:33.666
We are adventurers!

634
01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:34.750
Belalang!

635
01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:36.208
And who might you be?

636
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.916
I'm Bawang Merah.

637
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.583
I'm the guardian of this cave.

638
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:42.541
No time for this.

639
01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:45.541
The important thing is,

640
01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:48.125
how do we find the castle of Inderaloka?

641
01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.250
Serves you right.

642
01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:56.416
Because you're being rather rude.

643
01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:57.625
Are you okay?

644
01:01:57.708 --> 01:01:58.750
I'm fine.

645
01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:00.708
This swing belongs only to me.

646
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:04.708
Only I can sit on it. Like so.

647
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.833
Strange. Nobody is supposed to
know about this place.

648
01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.625
How did a lady like you get in here?

649
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.333
Long ago--

650
01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:19.375
Tell us!

651
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:26.333
I'm afraid… The truth is
that I'm trapped here.

652
01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:29.333
I was betrayed by my own sister,
Bawang Putih.

653
01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.166
-She broke my heart!
-Bawang Putih?

654
01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:35.833
Because of her, I was put in this place.

655
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:42.500
I shouldn't have done that to my sister.

656
01:02:44.958 --> 01:02:49.291
I regret it every day. Every single day.

657
01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:54.250
I want to see her.

658
01:02:56.583 --> 01:02:59.000
To say that I'm sorry.

659
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.916
Excuse me. But are you talking
here with us?

660
01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:09.333
Because… I did something terrible!

661
01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:11.458
I betrayed my sister.

662
01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:14.541
The king was furious.

663
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.666
Raja Bersiong.

664
01:03:18.416 --> 01:03:20.416
Hurry up, Jarjit.

665
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:22.833
It's those things again.

666
01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:28.916
Help me!

667
01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:35.666
I really miss Upin and Ipin.

668
01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:38.333
Are they alive or are they--?

669
01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.708
Don't say it. It's not true.

670
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:43.333
Upin and Ipin are the key!

671
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.875
What do you mean?

672
01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:53.125
Only those two boys can save us

673
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:56.166
and the entire kingdom of Inderaloka

674
01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:59.791
from the terrible, evil Raja Bersiong.

675
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.958
‪Upin and Ipin?‬

676
01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:06.083
Merah!

677
01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:13.958
Gee! What a happy story.

678
01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.583
Enough. We need to get out of here.

679
01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:18.333
We're wasting time.

680
01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.583
If I remember right,

681
01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:24.041
there is a pond
that shows the way to the castle.

682
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.833
Yes. There used to be,

683
01:04:26.916 --> 01:04:28.625
but the pond dried up,

684
01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:32.041
and the way to the castle
vanished along with it.

685
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:34.875
Don't fly away!

686
01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.166
Catch it, Upin!

687
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.708
Hey, you two little troublemakers.

688
01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:44.083
Put down my fairy!

689
01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:47.750
You're scary, like our sister Ros.

690
01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:49.208
Right, Ipin?

691
01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:52.041
Sister… Ros?

692
01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:55.250
We have a sister. Her name is Ros.

693
01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:58.291
She can be mean sometimes,
but she's actually a good person.

694
01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:00.500
She cooks us the best fried chicken!

695
01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:01.916
And when we get sick…

696
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.291
She takes care of us.

697
01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:04.791
And when we're being naughty…

698
01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:06.166
She'll get angry

699
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.541
and she pulls on our ears
and it hurts so much.

700
01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:11.833
Like this.

701
01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.625
You fall for that every time.

702
01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:39.666
But no matter how angry she gets,

703
01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:42.250
she gives us so much love.

704
01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:44.916
If we did something wrong,

705
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.458
she'd forgive us for sure
because she's our sister.

706
01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:50.208
Sisters have to take care
of little brothers.

707
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:53.000
Don't you think so?

708
01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:57.916
Yes, I do.

709
01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:01.208
Sisters must forgive each other.

710
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.250
Family is more important than anything.

711
01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:09.791
She is the only family
I have left in the world.

712
01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.541
Putih, where are you?

713
01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:17.083
I miss you so much, Putih.

714
01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.333
I forgive you, Putih.

715
01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:09.500
Swinging slow and free

716
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:13.000
As the wind calls to me

717
01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:19.500
Swinging to the sighings of my heart

718
01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:24.375
These tears will wash away

719
01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:28.083
All the pain of yesterday

720
01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.083
And this heart of mine

721
01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:34.833
Will learn how to love again

722
01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:54.250
"The kris will heed and obey."

723
01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.125
Ouch!

724
01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:31.291
Yes! I'm finally free.

725
01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:33.791
I'm finally free!

726
01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:38.791
Are we almost there?

727
01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:42.375
The castle of Inderaloka.

728
01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:46.791
Be careful.

729
01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:52.791
Hurry! Here!

730
01:08:59.582 --> 01:09:01.332
-They're gone.
-The coast is clear.

731
01:09:01.416 --> 01:09:02.375
Let's go.

732
01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:11.832
This looks like a jail.

733
01:09:12.041 --> 01:09:13.082
Cool!

734
01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:15.791
But it's empty. No bad guys in jail.

735
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:18.166
Upin! Ipin!

736
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.375
Guys!

737
01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:20.916
Come over here.

738
01:09:21.125 --> 01:09:22.207
Quiet!

739
01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.457
Come over here!

740
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:24.582
Upin!

741
01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:27.416
You guys have got to get us out of here.

742
01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:30.291
-Putih?
-Hurry.

743
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:31.541
Putih!

744
01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:32.666
Merah.

745
01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:34.707
My dear sister!

746
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.582
Belalang, your dad's
in the one over there.

747
01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:41.707
Yay! We can go home now.

748
01:09:42.082 --> 01:09:43.416
Belalang! Here.

749
01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.250
Dad, wake up!

750
01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:50.041
Dad!

751
01:09:51.416 --> 01:09:54.041
Belalang! Hurry. Let's get out of here!

752
01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:55.125
Hurry!

753
01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.583
Hurry!

754
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.750
Ipin, insects hate fire, right?

755
01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:07.666
I think so.

756
01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:17.875
Upin, watch out!

757
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.250
Come on!

758
01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:42.125
Run, Ipin!

759
01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:44.583
Run!

760
01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:45.791
Upin! Ipin!

761
01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:16.666
Jenin?

762
01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:48.000
Inderaloka belongs to me, Raja Bersiong!

763
01:11:48.875 --> 01:11:49.958
Go.

764
01:11:52.166 --> 01:11:54.208
Save the prince.

765
01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:05.250
The chosen one will return.

766
01:12:07.166 --> 01:12:11.208
The Lone Gibbon Kris will awaken.

767
01:12:11.416 --> 01:12:15.583
Tears will reveal your true identity.

768
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.375
Father!

769
01:12:18.708 --> 01:12:19.833
Jenin!

770
01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:23.000
You! Commander!

771
01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:24.250
You took me from him!

772
01:12:24.416 --> 01:12:26.708
Why? Why did you run?

773
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:28.666
Why didn't you help my father?

774
01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:31.166
What have you done, Ragam?

775
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:32.791
Why did you leave him to die?

776
01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:34.125
My lord!

777
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.833
My lord?

778
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:38.666
I was given orders
and I had to follow them.

779
01:12:38.916 --> 01:12:41.666
I was sworn to protect the royal family.

780
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.416
Whose orders were they? Whose?

781
01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:48.916
Your own father, the King of Inderaloka!

782
01:12:49.125 --> 01:12:50.750
-You are the only heir--
-No!

783
01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.166
Stop!

784
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:54.166
Everybody should stop fighting.

785
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:55.666
We're friends, right?

786
01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:59.250
Yeah! Whatever we do, we do it as a team.

787
01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.791
United we stand, divided we fall!

788
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.583
Father.

789
01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:16.083
All of this is my fault.

790
01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:19.708
I wasn't strong enough to save you.

791
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.458
Father, forgive me.

792
01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:25.833
You cannot blame yourself, my prince.

793
01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:28.500
No one could have seen it coming.

794
01:13:28.583 --> 01:13:31.750
But the time to act is now
if we're going to make this right.

795
01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:34.541
Think. Do you remember
what your father's final words were?

796
01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:35.708
Do you?

797
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:39.583
The chosen one will return.

798
01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:43.041
The Lone Gibbon Kris will awaken.

799
01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:46.958
Tears will reveal your true identity!

800
01:14:15.291 --> 01:14:17.666
"Two souls will guide the way.

801
01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:20.833
The kris will heed and obey.

802
01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.708
And good will--"

803
01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:28.500
Raja Bersiong!

804
01:14:32.666 --> 01:14:37.958
You've come back!
Finally, you have returned with the kris.

805
01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:41.333
The Lone G… Gibbon.

806
01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:43.916
Hand the kris over to me,

807
01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:48.291
and I might even let you live.
Quite a deal, don't you think?

808
01:14:48.541 --> 01:14:51.958
No! I swear to you,
this kris will be your undoing!

809
01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:00.166
The kris!

810
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:13.500
Commander!

811
01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:35.208
Ipin!

812
01:15:42.875 --> 01:15:46.125
You will lose,
just like your father before you!

813
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.375
Poor little prince.

814
01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:53.958
I am the all-powerful

815
01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:56.000
-Raja Bersiong!
-What should we do?

816
01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:58.458
-What do we do now?
-Ipin.

817
01:15:58.541 --> 01:15:59.750
We have to help him!

818
01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:01.458
-Can we do it?
-No one can defeat me.

819
01:16:03.583 --> 01:16:05.083
I'm scared.

820
01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:08.958
Together we can do this.

821
01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.750
Mat Jenin! Wake up.

822
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:34.375
You will pay for this!

823
01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.958
There are so many of them. What can we do?

824
01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:01.708
We have to fight!

825
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:04.041
Yeah, she's right. Don't give up.

826
01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:05.625
Don't you want to see home again?

827
01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.208
Yeah, I want some chicken.

828
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:10.041
Let's fight!

829
01:17:16.958 --> 01:17:18.333
Come on. Shoot!

830
01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:30.166
A banana tree trunk?

831
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.916
Mak Der!

832
01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:02.625
Who are they?

833
01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:04.458
Mak Deruma?

834
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:08.708
-Attack!
-Attack!

835
01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.875
I always wanted to be a pirate!
Time to set sail!

836
01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:43.541
Papa?

837
01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:47.875
Deruma, the Batu Belah
has opened. It's a sign! I'm sure of it.

838
01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:50.041
Yes. Let's just hope we're not too late.

839
01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:53.833
Mat Jenin! You've got to wake up!

840
01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:06.708
Your precious Lone Gibbon Kris
does nothing.

841
01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:11.041
It can't defeat me!

842
01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:14.708
Fancy name, but it looks like
your trinket is powerless!

843
01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:19.666
Ipin! Upin!

844
01:19:30.708 --> 01:19:31.791
My lord.

845
01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:33.791
Nakhoda!

846
01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:39.125
Seer. Handmaiden.

847
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:41.208
My lord.

848
01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.208
Don't you dare harm them, Bersiong!

849
01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:47.375
Let them go!

850
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.875
Are you really going to try
that kris again?

851
01:19:52.541 --> 01:19:55.125
My lord! You must read the inscription!

852
01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:56.750
Read it!

853
01:19:57.583 --> 01:20:00.083
Read it.

854
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.666
When stars of two…

855
01:20:09.375 --> 01:20:12.708
"When stars of two shine so bright,

856
01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:16.708
darkness soon will turn to light.

857
01:20:17.166 --> 01:20:20.000
Two souls will guide the way.

858
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:23.916
The kris will heed and obey.

859
01:20:24.916 --> 01:20:29.583
And good will win the fight!"

860
01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:45.541
Ready to surrender yet?

861
01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:13.083
-Upin! Ipin!
-Come!

862
01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:38.750
Watch out!

863
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.416
Come on!

864
01:21:57.833 --> 01:21:59.125
Three against one!

865
01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:01.666
Now!

866
01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:05.291
Get off me!

867
01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:25.208
‪How dare you!‬

868
01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:37.958
Upin, look!

869
01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:03.208
Upin!

870
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:15.916
Time for you to die!

871
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:22.791
We did it!

872
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:25.750
You'll pay for that!

873
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.250
Look!

874
01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:06.291
This kingdom is all mine!

875
01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:09.416
Ouch! It burns!

876
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:22.958
Take it off!

877
01:24:23.708 --> 01:24:25.500
No!

878
01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:28.875
Give it back!

879
01:24:34.708 --> 01:24:35.791
Hey!

880
01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:42.291
Impossible. I am immortal.

881
01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.333
I will never be defeated!

882
01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:13.375
Mat Jenin!

883
01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.125
Upin. Ipin.

884
01:25:26.416 --> 01:25:30.041
Hooray! We won!

885
01:25:36.875 --> 01:25:40.166
Long live the king!

886
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:43.833
Upin! Ipin!

887
01:25:46.166 --> 01:25:48.875
You guys are just awesome!

888
01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.083
Are you guys okay?

889
01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:55.583
-Of course.
-We did it!

890
01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.708
Thank goodness, you are all safe.

891
01:25:57.791 --> 01:25:59.666
We can all go home now!

892
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.666
Please don't go.

893
01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:07.083
I'm going to be all alone.

894
01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:11.750
You can come with us. Come on.

895
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.916
But I can't leave behind my papa.

896
01:26:18.583 --> 01:26:21.125
But that's why they have to leave.

897
01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:24.416
They have families at home.

898
01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:28.291
We can't wait to see
our grandma and sister again!

899
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.458
Hear that?

900
01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:33.416
The Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is open!

901
01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:34.916
Hurry!

902
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.458
We must head there now,
as fast as we possibly can!

903
01:26:37.541 --> 01:26:39.875
If it closes,
who knows when it'll open again?

904
01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:42.708
-But how do we get there? It's so far.
-Oh no! This is the end. We're doomed!

905
01:26:42.916 --> 01:26:44.416
Doomed!

906
01:26:58.541 --> 01:27:00.208
Long live the king!

907
01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:03.375
-He's so cute.
-Long live the king!

908
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.125
Hi.

909
01:27:27.333 --> 01:27:28.583
Mak Der.

910
01:27:28.958 --> 01:27:30.375
Be well.

911
01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.916
Bye-bye! Let's go!

912
01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:42.708
Come back soon.

913
01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:51.708
I'll be waiting!

914
01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.625
Over there!

915
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:08.250
Ipin!

916
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.958
He's still alive?

917
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:25.833
You think that you can defeat me?

918
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.541
I swear, I will destroy every one of you!

919
01:28:54.083 --> 01:28:55.375
Grab it, Ipin.

920
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.125
Two, three little boats!

921
01:29:13.458 --> 01:29:15.125
Look, I float!

922
01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:22.958
Papa!

923
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:25.416
They got me, too.

924
01:29:31.041 --> 01:29:32.000
Let me go!

925
01:29:32.083 --> 01:29:33.458
You're squeezing too hard.

926
01:29:57.791 --> 01:29:59.125
Mat Jenin!

927
01:30:19.666 --> 01:30:21.666
My heart!

928
01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:32.916
Help me! Get me out of here!

929
01:30:35.666 --> 01:30:37.916
You've met your end, Siong.

930
01:31:13.541 --> 01:31:15.500
Come on. Go!

931
01:31:17.458 --> 01:31:20.250
Are you sure this is the right way home?
It's so scary.

932
01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:25.166
You can trust my papa.

933
01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:27.291
He's Pak Belalang, the seer.

934
01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:29.166
Thank you, all.

935
01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:31.958
For helping me take back my kingdom.

936
01:31:35.958 --> 01:31:37.625
We must say our goodbyes here.

937
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:42.791
Mat Jenin.

938
01:31:55.041 --> 01:31:56.583
Papa!

939
01:32:03.083 --> 01:32:04.625
It's okay to cry.

940
01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:07.416
But let's try a smile.

941
01:32:08.833 --> 01:32:11.000
When will we ever see you again?

942
01:32:14.666 --> 01:32:15.958
Someday soon.

943
01:32:22.666 --> 01:32:24.833
Oh, I can't take it. Bye-bye.

944
01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.333
Now, go on.

945
01:32:30.708 --> 01:32:33.416
-Let's go.
-Bye! Don't forget to write!

946
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:42.000
-Come on.
-Bye!

947
01:32:42.416 --> 01:32:43.750
-Bye.
-Upin! Ipin!

948
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.625
Give it to Atok.

949
01:32:50.708 --> 01:32:53.583
A gift from me
and the people of Inderaloka.

950
01:32:54.416 --> 01:32:56.250
A gift? What do you mean?

951
01:32:56.333 --> 01:32:58.333
This kris is Atok's.

952
01:32:59.458 --> 01:33:01.208
We've got to go!

953
01:33:04.583 --> 01:33:06.208
Ipin, where are you?

954
01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:07.875
Where are my glasses?

955
01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:10.083
Where are we now?

956
01:33:12.625 --> 01:33:13.666
We're back!

957
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:17.208
-Yay! We're home!
-We made it!

958
01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:20.500
The Lone Gib--

959
01:33:20.875 --> 01:33:22.916
Open the chest! Hurry!

960
01:33:24.916 --> 01:33:26.041
Careful!

961
01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:29.416
-And what are you doing?
-You scared us.

962
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.666
Are you sneaking around?

963
01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:34.125
Atok!

964
01:33:37.041 --> 01:33:38.625
We missed you, Tok!

965
01:33:39.166 --> 01:33:41.166
We really did!

966
01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:43.541
I leave you alone
for just five little minutes

967
01:33:43.625 --> 01:33:45.375
and look what happened.

968
01:33:46.208 --> 01:33:47.500
Just five minutes?

969
01:33:47.583 --> 01:33:49.041
That can't be!

970
01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:50.791
Wow! Nice and tidy!

971
01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.458
Good job!

972
01:33:52.541 --> 01:33:53.541
Come!

973
01:33:53.625 --> 01:33:55.625
I'm treating you all to some ice-cream!

974
01:33:57.083 --> 01:33:58.083
Let's go!

975
01:34:04.041 --> 01:34:05.166
Come on, Tok.

976
01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:06.916
We have lots and lots to tell you!

977
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.458
All right.

978
01:34:08.541 --> 01:34:09.583
Come on!

979
01:34:09.666 --> 01:34:10.833
You little troublemakers.

980
01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.125
Your Majesty!

981
01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:25.125
-One, two--
-Your Majesty!

982
01:36:25.208 --> 01:36:26.375
They need our help!

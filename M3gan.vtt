5

♪ Because now you have a friend

6
00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:25.270
Purrpetual Petz
are just like real pets,

7
00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:27.679
except that when you talk to
them, they actually talk back!

8
00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:29.245
Amazeballs!

9
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.407
There's over
six different Petz to collect,

10
00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:35.148
each equipped with their own personalities
and entirely spontaneous reactions!

11
00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:36.580
Careful. That's my butt.

12
00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:38.545
They speak
eight different languages.

13
00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:41.468
They can take pictures.

14
00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:43.550
Come on, sweetheart.
Find the lens.

15
00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.928
And with the customized
app, you can even feed your friend.

16
00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:48.063
But not too much!

17
00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:50.531
Uh-oh. Cleanup on aisle seven.

18
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.306
The app is updated
with new content daily,

19
00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:54.061
so you can do
almost anything together.

20
00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.472
You can watch YouTube videos,
learn fun facts,

21
00:01:56.607 --> 00:01:58.904
play multiplatform games,
buy accessories for your Pet.

22
00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.103
With so many options, what
will you and your Pet do next?

23
00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:08.442
Mmm, jelly berries
makes me feel good.

24
00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:12.031
Cady, look. We're almost
at the top of the mountain.

25
00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:14.021
Can you see the hotel?

26
00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:17.252
Ooh, well, that's interesting. Do
you know what else is interesting?

27
00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:20.058
Oopsie-daisy!

28
00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:22.500
I thought we were gonna limit
screen time to 30 minutes a day.

29
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.438
What are you telling me for?
I didn't give it to her.

30
00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:26.876
I'm just saying, I think... Cady,
can you turn it down, please?

31
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.998
I need to go to the bathroom.
Are we there yet?

32
00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:30.836
If we make rules,
we need to stick to them.

33
00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:32.973
If she wasn't on that,
she'd be climbing all over.

34
00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:35.977
So you would rather she
sat there feeding a toy virtual food

35
00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:37.209
until it shits itself?

36
00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:38.905
Cady, turn it down.

37
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.446
I already did turn it down.

38
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:42.644
What was Gemma thinking?

39
00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.663
"It's my niece's birthday.
I'm gonna get her a present."

40
00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:46.600
She works for
the company that makes them.

41
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.716
She probably didn't even have to
pay for shipping.

42
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:52.789
Honestly, what is the purpose of a toy
if you have to play with it on an iPad?

43
00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:54.592
This is what
the future looks like, okay?

44
00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:56.531
You just have to
get used to it.

45
00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:58.768
Oh, my God!

46
00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:00.802
And away we go!

47
00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:03.168
- We're all right.
- We should've put chains on the car.

48
00:03:03.304 --> 00:03:06.104
Neither of us knew that was a thing
until, like, ten minutes ago, okay?

49
00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:07.669
Don't act like it's my fault.

50
00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:09.743
Oh, my God! Ryan! Seriously!

51
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.178
What do you want me
to do? Mom, I dropped Leroy.

52
00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:15.257
Why did you tell that guy at
the gate this was a four-wheel drive?

53
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:17.601
- Help me, Cady.
- It looks like a four-wheel drive.

54
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.181
Cady, what are you doing?

55
00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:21.597
- Cady, Cady. Jesus Christ!
- Cady, put your seat belt on!

56
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.459
- I can't see anything.
- So stop moving forward.

57
00:03:28.863 --> 00:03:30.796
We can't just sit
in the middle of the road.

58
00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:34.865
Look,
we'll wait for this to clear,

59
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:36.817
and then find some place
where we can pull over

60
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:40.000
and just wait for one of those
snow trucks to clear the road.

61
00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.675
Yeah,
how long is that gonna take?

62
00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:06.832
Funki,
a toy company for the future.

63
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.298
Remember,
the key to fun is Funki.

64
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.774
- Why are we doing this?
- Because we have to.

65
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.047
If we could at least show him
what we have,

66
00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:52.548
he would...
No. Mm-mmm.

67
00:04:52.683 --> 00:04:54.410
You said so yourself.
Not until she's ready.

68
00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:57.487
Hey.

69
00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:02.283
Is that what I think it is?

70
00:05:28.617 --> 00:05:30.586
Transparency looks good.

71
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:33.012
Yeah, well, for what
we paid for it, it better.

72
00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:35.285
Okay, here we go.

73
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:36.526
Happy.

74
00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:39.325
Okay.

75
00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:40.695
Sad.

76
00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:44.167
Confused.

77
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:45.464
Wait, wait. Stop.

78
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.926
Why is her face doing that?

79
00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:48.428
What is happening?

80
00:05:48.563 --> 00:05:50.330
I... I don't know, Gemma.
It's your code.

81
00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:52.136
Yeah, thanks.
I know it's my code, Cole,

82
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.971
but she doesn't look confused.
She looks demented.

83
00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:57.109
You want me to
take the skin back off?

84
00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:00.649
- Well, she's not responding. So...
- Okay, here we go.

85
00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:05.120
- Oh, shit. It's stuck.
- Just be care...

86
00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:06.855
Hey, don't tear it.

87
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.136
I know. I'm not gonna tear... Ow.

88
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.185
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

89
00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.088
Okay, so what do we do?

90
00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:15.323
I guess we gotta open the door.

91
00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:20.636
Gem.

92
00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:24.970
What in the name of
ever-loving Christ is this?

93
00:06:25.105 --> 00:06:27.207
David, if you just give me
a minute to explain...

94
00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:30.204
Is this why you moved your lab,
Gemma? So you can keep secrets from me?

95
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.245
No, no, no.
We talked about this, David.

96
00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:35.878
We talked about you putting it on
ice until you had a new Petz model.

97
00:06:36.013 --> 00:06:37.917
How much did you spend on this?

98
00:06:38.717 --> 00:06:40.483
Are you even aware

99
00:06:40.618 --> 00:06:43.027
of the shit tsunami that just
swept in over this Furzeez spot?

100
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:44.385
I'm sorry, what?

101
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.191
♪ Furzeez, Furzeez ♪

102
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.066

107
00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:01.985
Are we supposed to be
worried about that? It's a rip-off.

108
00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.072
You're right, Gemma.
It is a rip-off.

109
00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:05.946
They do the exact same thing
we do.

110
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.847
And you know what else?
They do it for half the price.

111
00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:12.220
I told you
we needed to go simpler.

112
00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:13.685
Didn't I tell her?

113
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:15.817
Six months ago,
I begged you...

114
00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:20.389
I begged you to please give me an
option I can put on a shelf for 50 bucks.

115
00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:22.655
- And we are working on it. I promise.
- Yeah.

116
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.230
But, David, the only way
to stay ahead of the competition

117
00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:28.234
is to come up with toys that
are too advanced to replicate.

118
00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:30.849
I know the tech on Petz seems
more complex than it needs to be,

119
00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:34.202
but that's only because I was using it
as a launchpad for something bigger.

120
00:07:34.338 --> 00:07:36.646
In each Pet,
we installed a listening model

121
00:07:36.782 --> 00:07:39.446
that targets conversational
patterns among kids.

122
00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:40.880
You did not just tell me that.

123
00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:42.876
I know she doesn't
look like much now,

124
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.716
but I promise, if you just let us
show you what M3gan is capable of,

125
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:48.892
you will realize that this is what
we've been working towards.

126
00:07:49.027 --> 00:07:50.027
M3gan?

127
00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:52.387
"Model 3 Generative Android."

128
00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:54.422
"M3gan" for short.

129
00:07:55.864 --> 00:07:57.727
Tess,
load up the intro simulation.

130
00:07:57.863 --> 00:07:59.035
- Now?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:02.567
M3gan, say hi to David.

132
00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:04.464
As in the boss David?

133
00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:06.566
Well, I guess
I should call you Dad.

134
00:08:08.803 --> 00:08:10.843
Allow me to tell you a
little bit about my wormhole.

135
00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:14.250
I was born in a sandwich hat,
and I wolf many cabbages.

136
00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:15.717
Uh...

137
00:08:15.853 --> 00:08:17.813
This isn't supposed to happen,
obviously.

138
00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:19.288
Just give me one moment.

139
00:08:19.423 --> 00:08:20.818
Sorry about the noise.

140
00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:23.050
- Gem?
- One second, Cole.

141
00:08:23.185 --> 00:08:25.704
It's probably just a race condition.
It'll take me a minute to fix.

142
00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:27.492
Gem, it's not a race condition.

143
00:08:27.628 --> 00:08:29.948
I might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier.

144
00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:31.335
Oh, no.

145
00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:32.802
- God.
- Tess, turn it off!

146
00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:34.862
I can't.

147
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:50.851
I want the Petz prototype
on my desk by Friday.

148
00:08:50.987 --> 00:08:54.956
And I want you to take
this cyborg puppet show

149
00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:58.024
and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs.

150
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:06.032
And I want a swipe card
for this door!

151
00:09:10.503 --> 00:09:14.535
For what it's worth, I
thought she looked really cool.

152
00:09:40.668 --> 00:09:44.007
Sweetie, it's gonna be
okay. We're gonna take care of you.

153
00:09:44.142 --> 00:09:47.535
Just need to check your
blood pressure. It'll be all right.

154
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.713
Radiology, pick up line four.

155
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.882
So, this is to grant
you temporary protective custody.

156
00:09:55.018 --> 00:09:57.446
Just sign your name
and date it at the bottom.

157
00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:01.288
Thank you.

158
00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:03.917
Now, I don't know if your sister
had a family lawyer already,

159
00:10:04.052 --> 00:10:07.522
but if not, it would be something
to consider moving forward.

160
00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:03.952
Hey! Hey! Hey! Celia!

161
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:07.580
Could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence?

162
00:11:07.716 --> 00:11:09.658
I just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar.

163
00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:11.924
Maybe try
cranking it up a notch.

164
00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:13.388
Oh, who's this little lady?

165
00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:15.423
That is my niece, Cady.

166
00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:17.231
Is she staying for the weekend?

167
00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:19.932
You know what? It's been
a really long drive, and, um,

168
00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:22.094
I would just
really appreciate it

169
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.834
if you did not have your dog
running onto my yard all the time.

170
00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:29.003
And also, don't spray your
chemicals onto my driveway, please.

171
00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:32.071
Ah, shit. I'm sorry. You wanna
borrow this once I'm done?

172
00:11:32.207 --> 00:11:34.521
No, I don't wanna borrow it.
I don't wanna spend my afternoon

173
00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:36.145
getting your sediment
off of my driveway.

174
00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:37.581
Just hang a tarp or something.

175
00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:38.717
Okay.

176
00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:45.060
Welcome home, Gemma.

177
00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:47.188
You have six
unanswered voice messages

178
00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:48.863
and five Tinder notifications.

179
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:50.900
Elsie, turn off.

180
00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:53.463
Sorry about that.

181
00:11:55.038 --> 00:11:58.237
Okay.
I'm gonna put these bags away.

182
00:11:59.273 --> 00:12:02.505
And, um, just make yourself
at home. Okay?

183
00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:19.655
Oh, those aren't toys, Cady.

184
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.291
I mean... Yeah, technically,
yeah, they're toys.

185
00:12:22.427 --> 00:12:24.459
They're just, um,
collectibles.

186
00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:26.636
So you don't actually
play with them.

187
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.533
That probably sounds
really weird.

188
00:12:28.669 --> 00:12:29.873
Um...

189
00:12:32.373 --> 00:12:34.871
I'm trying to think
if I have anything...

190
00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:38.541
Oh, what happened to the Purrpetual
Pet I got you for your birthday?

191
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.214
It's okay.

192
00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:43.249
I was just looking.

193
00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:51.587
I know it doesn't look like
much right now, but, um,

194
00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:55.426
we will make it feel
cozy somehow. I promise.

195
00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:00.970
There.

196
00:13:09.347 --> 00:13:10.375
Look...

197
00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:18.351
I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now.

198
00:13:18.487 --> 00:13:20.690
I just want you to know
I'm gonna do everything I can

199
00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:22.849
to make this place
feel like home.

200
00:13:23.827 --> 00:13:26.754
And, um, if you need anything,

201
00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:29.592
I'm just gonna be down the hall.

202
00:13:30.931 --> 00:13:32.628
Okay? Really close.

203
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.933
You're not gonna
read me a story?

204
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:38.238
What's that?

205
00:13:39.207 --> 00:13:41.307
Mom always
read me a story before bed.

206
00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:44.406
Oh, um...

207
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:48.579
I don't... I don't think I really have
any kids' books here right now, Cady.

208
00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:51.779
Um, but that's okay.
I can download one on my phone.

209
00:13:52.821 --> 00:13:53.957
That's fine.

210
00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.357
It's just...

211
00:13:56.492 --> 00:13:57.521
Oh.

212
00:13:59.556 --> 00:14:01.030
I just have to
update the app.

213
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.084
I can't believe this is happening.
I'm not equipped to handle this.

214
00:14:56.219 --> 00:14:58.021
I don't even take care
of my own plants.

215
00:14:58.156 --> 00:15:00.083
Have you heard from
Ryan's parents?

216
00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:02.799
Yeah, they called and offered to
help, but, like, they live in Florida.

217
00:15:02.823 --> 00:15:04.869
They're kind of weird.
I don't know what their deal is.

218
00:15:04.893 --> 00:15:07.613
I'm just trying to figure out a
way to do this without getting fired.

219
00:15:07.694 --> 00:15:09.929
David's gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off.

220
00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:13.265
Yeah, I know. But, Jesus,
Gem, you just lost your sister.

221
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.005
And we spent $100,000
of company funds

222
00:15:16.141 --> 00:15:18.236
on a product
that he didn't even ask for.

223
00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:21.367
If we don't get this Petz prototype
to him soon, he's going to sue us.

224
00:15:21.502 --> 00:15:25.037
Okay, I don't think you can be
worrying about work right now, Gem.

225
00:15:25.172 --> 00:15:27.342
Right now, I think
you just need to focus on Cady.

226
00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:28.878
What...

227
00:15:29.014 --> 00:15:30.053
Hold on.

228
00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:34.556
Hi.

229
00:15:34.657 --> 00:15:35.850
Hi.

230
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.853
I'm Lydia.

231
00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:41.555
Oh! The therapist?

232
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.495
Sorry, yeah.
Please, come in.

233
00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:50.203
And you must be Cady.

234
00:15:50.338 --> 00:15:52.469
Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

235
00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:54.125
Yeah, we were just watching TV.

236
00:15:54.238 --> 00:15:55.375
I see that.

237
00:15:59.949 --> 00:16:02.282
So, how does this work?

238
00:16:02.418 --> 00:16:04.447
I just need to observe
the two of you together

239
00:16:04.583 --> 00:16:06.316
for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

240
00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:08.888
Oh. Okay.
Doing what, exactly?

241
00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:10.324
Oh, just hanging out.

242
00:16:11.493 --> 00:16:14.163
Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

243
00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:16.339
Hey, Cady, do you wanna grab
some toys to play with?

244
00:16:16.396 --> 00:16:17.934
I don't have any toys here.

245
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:19.764
I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

246
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.095
They're just old. I don't
think she plays with them.

247
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.468
- What about these ones up here?
- Those aren't toys.

248
00:16:24.604 --> 00:16:27.484
They're Aunt Gemma's collectibles.
You're not supposed to play with them.

249
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.611
That's okay.
We can play with them.

250
00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:35.283
We can totally play with them.
Do you wanna play with them?

251
00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:37.384
You wanna play...
Yeah.

252
00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:39.452
Play with it.
No big deal.

253
00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:05.862
There's a lever you have to pull
on the bottom...

254
00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.046
Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

255
00:17:08.182 --> 00:17:09.876
we might let Cady lead.

256
00:17:10.012 --> 00:17:11.851
Yeah, I'm just
explaining how it works.

257
00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:14.553
Well, it's a toy. I'm sure
it's not that complicated.

258
00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:19.195
That's great, Cady. Do you
want to roll it to Aunt Gemma?

259
00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:26.664
It's just that this is not what it was
designed to do. It does other things.

260
00:17:29.664 --> 00:17:31.472
But, yeah, totally.

261
00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:34.106
Let's just roll it on the ground
like a tennis ball.

262
00:17:34.242 --> 00:17:35.541
Let's do that instead.

263
00:17:42.585 --> 00:17:44.782
We'll do a few more sessions
with Cady initially,

264
00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:46.630
but that can happen
at your office or school.

265
00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:48.494
Yeah. I haven't had time
to look into that yet.

266
00:17:48.593 --> 00:17:51.889
Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it's on my list.

267
00:17:52.024 --> 00:17:55.660
Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?

268
00:17:56.898 --> 00:17:57.898
Oh...

269
00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:00.670
- I don't know.
- But you wanted this, right?

270
00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:01.736
To take custody?

271
00:18:01.871 --> 00:18:03.833
Yeah, of course.

272
00:18:03.968 --> 00:18:05.770
Okay, because
the father's parents have said

273
00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:07.665
they're willing to take her
if it's too much.

274
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.718
Wait. Did they contact
you? It's no big deal, Gemma.

275
00:18:09.742 --> 00:18:11.605
They're just trying to be
supportive.

276
00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:14.122
If Nicole wanted Cady to go to
Jacksonville, she would have said so.

277
00:18:14.146 --> 00:18:16.877
But even so, I need to make my
own recommendations to the court

278
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.888
as to whether or not
this is a safe space.

279
00:18:20.024 --> 00:18:23.556
So, you're gonna need to make one or
two adjustments in order for this to work.

280
00:18:25.454 --> 00:18:26.559
Okay.

281
00:18:49.018 --> 00:18:50.683
Listen, Cady, um,

282
00:18:50.818 --> 00:18:54.720
I have this project at work
that's kind of overdue.

283
00:18:54.856 --> 00:18:57.458
And with all the time that
I had to take off last week,

284
00:18:57.593 --> 00:18:59.460
I'm not really sure
I'm gonna get it done.

285
00:19:02.964 --> 00:19:06.098
Anyway, it's not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours.

286
00:19:06.233 --> 00:19:10.268
But if you could just hold down
the fort by yourself for a little while,

287
00:19:10.404 --> 00:19:12.634
that would help me so much.

288
00:19:12.769 --> 00:19:15.235
You can use my iPad if you want.

289
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.111
You can FaceTime a friend
or play a game or something.

290
00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:20.615
What about screen time?

291
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.977
Hmm?

292
00:19:22.946 --> 00:19:24.945
How long
before I have to turn it off?

293
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.247
Oh, I don't care.
As long as you want.

294
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:31.085
I'm not gonna be gone that long.
I'll just be down the hall.

295
00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:34.063
And, uh, when I'm done,
we can go out somewhere.

296
00:19:34.198 --> 00:19:37.564
We can...
go to a playground or...

297
00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:39.731
get something to eat.

298
00:19:40.562 --> 00:19:41.667
Okay?

299
00:20:14.002 --> 00:20:15.162
Cady?

300
00:20:19.042 --> 00:20:21.039
Cady, I'm sorry.

301
00:20:21.174 --> 00:20:22.174
Come here.

302
00:20:28.013 --> 00:20:30.276
I'm not off to
a very good start here, am I?

303
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:34.283
What is this?
Did you draw a picture?

304
00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:35.824
Oh, my God.

305
00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:37.157
This is amazing.

306
00:20:37.293 --> 00:20:38.520
I'm still working on it.

307
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.388
Tell me.

308
00:20:40.523 --> 00:20:43.159
It was actually supposed to be
a different animal for each head.

309
00:20:43.295 --> 00:20:44.530
Mm-hmm.

310
00:20:44.666 --> 00:20:46.172
Like, this one
was supposed to be a tiger.

311
00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:48.361
And this one was supposed
to be a grizzly bear,

312
00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:50.500
but I can never seem
to get the fur right. Mmm.

313
00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:52.631
It's hard. I can relate.

314
00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:55.642
I've actually been working
with some furry creatures myself.

315
00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:57.974
Do you wanna see?

316
00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.679
Yeah?

317
00:21:01.415 --> 00:21:04.416
So we're working on a version of
the Purrpetual Pet that's cheaper,

318
00:21:04.551 --> 00:21:06.284
but we still want it to be fun.

319
00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:09.084
So, what do you think?

320
00:21:11.994 --> 00:21:13.022
Yeah.

321
00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:15.090
What's that?

322
00:21:16.228 --> 00:21:17.393
Oh!

323
00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:18.690
That's Bruce.

324
00:21:18.826 --> 00:21:20.868
Is he a toy?

325
00:21:21.004 --> 00:21:22.638
Yeah, kinda.

326
00:21:22.774 --> 00:21:25.265
He's a proxy robot. I built
him when I was in college.

327
00:21:26.705 --> 00:21:28.604
Why doesn't he have a face?

328
00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:32.743
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It's a pretty obvious design flaw.

329
00:21:32.879 --> 00:21:35.275
Okay, hold on.
Let's see what we have.

330
00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:42.286
Let's see this.

331
00:21:42.421 --> 00:21:43.421
How's that?

332
00:21:44.824 --> 00:21:46.429
Would you maybe
want to talk to him?

333
00:21:47.358 --> 00:21:48.596
Yes.

334
00:21:49.064 --> 00:21:50.389
Okay.

335
00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:05.980
Hey, Cady. What's up?

336
00:22:06.115 --> 00:22:07.406
Give me five.

337
00:22:10.312 --> 00:22:12.147
Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.

338
00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:16.421
Ouch, girl. Not so hard.

339
00:22:16.557 --> 00:22:18.517
How does he work?

340
00:22:18.652 --> 00:22:21.261
Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

341
00:22:21.397 --> 00:22:23.499
I won't get freaked out.

342
00:22:24.495 --> 00:22:25.660
Okay.

343
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.100
Let's see what we've got here.

344
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.672
Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras.

345
00:22:35.808 --> 00:22:38.643
That is a laser. That's radar.

346
00:22:38.778 --> 00:22:42.641
These are bump sensors, so he can tell
the difference between a human and a hard surface.

347
00:22:42.777 --> 00:22:46.418
And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

348
00:22:46.554 --> 00:22:48.118
It's his brain?
Yeah.

349
00:22:48.254 --> 00:22:51.193
And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

350
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.194
I can't believe you made this.

351
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.260
Yeah. He's pretty cool.

352
00:22:55.396 --> 00:22:57.876
But the problem with toys like
Bruce is that they're so expensive,

353
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.959
and most kids
can't afford to have one.

354
00:23:00.095 --> 00:23:01.769
If I had a toy like Bruce,

355
00:23:01.904 --> 00:23:04.364
I don't think I'd ever
need another toy again.

Okay, so we've got this one
or the one with the bangs.

364
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.525
A little bit of auburn chic. I
really think you gotta revisit this.

365
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.563
- No, absolutely not.
- Look at that.

366
00:24:04.898 --> 00:24:06.833
Hold on just a second.
No, no, no.

367
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.766
- Shit.
- What is this?

368
00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:12.901
Where's Gemma?

369
00:24:13.002 --> 00:24:14.902
Where's my prototype?

370
00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:19.439
Uh, David, I just wanna be exceedingly
clear that this was not my idea.

371
00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:30.087
Cady, there's someone
I want you to meet.

372
00:24:32.026 --> 00:24:34.629
Do you remember
how much you liked Bruce?

373
00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:37.798
I think you're gonna like M3gan
even more.

374
00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:41.468
You see, Bruce requires
someone else to operate him,

375
00:24:41.603 --> 00:24:44.739
but M3gan works all on her own.

376
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.774
Okay, what I want you to do

377
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:50.977
is take your fingers
and put them here.

378
00:24:51.112 --> 00:24:54.079
And when you do that,
you're gonna pair with her.

379
00:24:54.214 --> 00:24:56.582
That means she'll recognize you
as her primary user.

380
00:24:56.717 --> 00:24:59.244
She's yours and yours alone.

381
00:24:59.379 --> 00:25:01.585
So just keep your fingers there

382
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.318
and say your name.

383
00:25:04.757 --> 00:25:07.124
Hi, M3gan. I'm Cady.

384
00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:11.095
It's nice to meet you, Cady.

385
00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:18.267
Ooh, I like that jacket.
Where'd you get it?

386
00:25:19.644 --> 00:25:22.610
I'm not sure.
I can't remember.

387
00:25:22.746 --> 00:25:25.873
Oh. Well, anyway,
it looks good on you.

388
00:25:26.008 --> 00:25:27.210
Do you wanna hang out?

389
00:25:29.746 --> 00:25:30.851
Okay.

390
00:25:53.474 --> 00:25:54.672
Shall we draw?

391
00:25:54.808 --> 00:25:56.805
What are you going to draw?

392
00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.538
See if you can guess.

393
00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:23.733
There's nothing there.

394
00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:25.939
Oh. I'm sorry.

395
00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:47.026
Do you like it, Cady?

396
00:26:50.057 --> 00:26:51.189
I love it.

397
00:26:51.325 --> 00:26:53.230
Jesus.

398
00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.564
This is incredible.

399
00:26:58.571 --> 00:26:59.599
I mean,

400
00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:02.935
this is unbelievable, isn't it?

401
00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:04.703
Yeah, it is.

402
00:27:06.911 --> 00:27:08.407
How did you do this?

403
00:27:08.542 --> 00:27:10.349
I thought you didn't wanna know.

404
00:27:10.485 --> 00:27:13.412
That wasn't a simulation, right?
That kid's not an actress?

405
00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:15.322
No, that's my niece, Cady.

406
00:27:15.457 --> 00:27:17.730
We need to get this in front of
the board. I was just gonna say...

407
00:27:17.754 --> 00:27:20.719
But first things first,
let's talk manufacturing costs.

408
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:23.295
More or less than a Tesla?

409
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:24.431
Um...

410
00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:26.795
Depends on the model,
I guess.

411
00:27:26.931 --> 00:27:28.463
Okay, I'm in.

412
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.631
I'm all in.

413
00:27:30.766 --> 00:27:32.512
But we're asking the board
to invest in something

414
00:27:32.536 --> 00:27:34.472
that's not gonna see a profit
for three years.

415
00:27:34.607 --> 00:27:37.440
So bottom line is, this isn't
going anywhere without Greg.

416
00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:40.014
- He's the chairman.
- Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt.

417
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:43.277
Now, Greg is a hard-ass
when it comes to spending money.

418
00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:46.820
But here's the thing, he's got a kid
who's about the same age as your niece.

419
00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:49.486
If we can show him
what you just showed me

420
00:27:49.622 --> 00:27:52.922
and get him to respond
emotionally instead of analytically,

421
00:27:53.058 --> 00:27:54.788
we should be off to the races.

422
00:27:54.924 --> 00:27:57.761
So, can we keep the girl?
Can we make her part of it?

423
00:27:57.896 --> 00:28:00.600
She's paired with her, right?
That's how this whole thing works?

424
00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:03.736
Yeah, the more time she spends with
Cady, the more effective she's gonna be.

425
00:28:03.764 --> 00:28:06.073
Love it.
Kurt, get Shelley on the phone.

426
00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:08.408
Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation

427
00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:10.635
that makes it sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

428
00:28:10.713 --> 00:28:11.845
Holy shit, this is exciting.

429
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.500
I want you all
to remember this moment.

430
00:28:13.578 --> 00:28:16.346
The moment we kicked Hasbro
right in the dick.

431
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:22.983
The new Model 3
Generative Android from Funki

432
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:26.659
is a fully autonomous humanoid
robot with features never before seen

433
00:28:26.795 --> 00:28:28.825
in the consumer market.

434
00:28:28.961 --> 00:28:31.739
Here are all of Aunt Gemma's
collectibles, and this one is my favorite.

435
00:28:31.763 --> 00:28:34.395
Oh! I have more awesome toys
in my room. Come on. Come on.

436
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.963
Sculpted from a titanium core,

437
00:28:37.098 --> 00:28:40.535
M3gan's designed to withstand
whatever life can throw at her.

438
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.511
She comes equipped
with an A17 bionic fusion chip

439
00:28:43.646 --> 00:28:47.844
and can be fully customized through
six different silicone skin pigmentations.

440
00:28:47.979 --> 00:28:51.779
But the most exciting aspects about
M3gan are the features still to come.

441
00:28:51.914 --> 00:28:54.285
Through our own unique approach
to probabilistic inference,

442
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.557
M3gan is on a constant quest
for self-improvement.

443
00:28:57.692 --> 00:29:00.727
Whether it's diagnosing children
with specific learning differences

444
00:29:00.863 --> 00:29:03.994
or merely reminding them of
the way science is all around us...

445
00:29:04.129 --> 00:29:05.897
Cady, you should use a coaster.

446
00:29:06.032 --> 00:29:07.829
Why do I have to use a coaster?

447
00:29:07.965 --> 00:29:11.803
Coasters help to avoid water
marks, especially on wooden surfaces.

448
00:29:11.939 --> 00:29:16.334
- But how does the water get outside the glass?
- That's a great question, Cady.

449
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.373
It's actually caused by the difference
in temperature outside the glass,

450
00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:21.072
which pulls moisture
from the air.

451
00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:22.241
Crazy.

452
00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:24.519
It's insane, right?

453
00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:28.451
Studies indicate that a
staggering 78% of a parent's time

454
00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:30.886
is spent dishing out
the same basic instructions.

455
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:35.196
Oh, my God. Cady, you have to
flush the toilet. It is not that hard.

456
00:29:35.332 --> 00:29:37.132
So we found someone else
to pick up the slack.

457
00:29:37.194 --> 00:29:38.692
Cady, flush the toilet.

458
00:29:41.504 --> 00:29:42.504
Wash your hands.

459
00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:44.434
Roll up your sleeves.

460
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.405
Great job.

461
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:51.056
It was my friend
Jenny's birthday.

462
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.560
M3gan's an excellent listener.

463
00:29:52.643 --> 00:29:54.552
This guy told them
that the 13th floor was haunted.

464
00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:56.174
Right.
And they accidentally...

465
00:29:56.309 --> 00:29:58.269
And she even has
a few stories of her own.

466
00:29:58.387 --> 00:30:00.707
"If it was so, it might be,

467
00:30:00.758 --> 00:30:04.385
and if it were so, it would be,
but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."

468
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.800
"Said Tweedledee."

469
00:30:05.853 --> 00:30:07.287
She'll never run out of ways

470
00:30:07.423 --> 00:30:08.964
to keep your child occupied,

471
00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:10.765
and she'll never
run out of patience.

472
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.628
Cady. Seriously,
flush the toilet.

473
00:30:23.606 --> 00:30:26.642
With M3gan around,
she'll take care of the little things,

474
00:30:26.777 --> 00:30:30.183
so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter.

475
00:30:31.384 --> 00:30:33.280
And then it can end
with something like,

476
00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:36.458
"M3gan. She's more than just
a toy. She's part of the family."

477
00:30:36.593 --> 00:30:39.359
Looks good. You're not gonna
do the voice though, right?

478
00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:41.856
No. Obviously, David's gonna
make up his own version of it.

479
00:30:41.992 --> 00:30:45.327
I just want him to be aware
of what it is that he's selling.

480
00:30:45.462 --> 00:30:47.695
Tess,
your silence indicates what?

481
00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:50.135
I... I don't know.

482
00:30:50.271 --> 00:30:52.174
- I'm not sure.
- About what?

483
00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.466
Well, why would you want
M3gan to do all that stuff?

484
00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:57.604
They're emergent capabilities.
She'll be able to do all of that and more.

485
00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.174
Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

486
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.144
I thought we were creating a tool to
help support parents, not replace them.

487
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.820
If you're having M3gan tuck Cady
in and read her a bedtime story,

488
00:31:07.956 --> 00:31:11.423
then when are you ever spending
time with her or even talking with her?

489
00:31:11.558 --> 00:31:13.655
I don't really think
this is any of your business.

490
00:31:14.388 --> 00:31:16.696
Well, it is.

491
00:31:16.831 --> 00:31:19.766
If you're spending less time with
your child as a result of M3gan,

492
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.796
- that is something we should be aware of.
- She's not my child.

493
00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:28.341
Look, you know how hard I've
been working on this presentation.

494
00:31:28.476 --> 00:31:30.556
As soon as it's over
and the board agrees to proceed,

495
00:31:30.608 --> 00:31:32.979
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

496
00:31:33.115 --> 00:31:36.155
But for now, it's important that Cady and
M3gan spend as much time as possible together.

497
00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:38.460
By the way, I don't think
it's having detrimental effects,

498
00:31:38.514 --> 00:31:41.153
because she's the happiest
she's been since her parents died.

499
00:31:41.289 --> 00:31:42.653
How did Cady's parents die?

500
00:31:42.788 --> 00:31:44.857
- Whoa.
- I thought she was turned off.

501
00:31:44.992 --> 00:31:46.654
Yeah, M3gan, turn off.

502
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.056
Cady James. Daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James.

503
00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:53.260
Killed in a collision on
Interstate 84 outside of Oregon.

504
00:31:53.395 --> 00:31:54.861
Why is she doing that?

505
00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:56.533
Shit, she's still
paired with Cady.

506
00:31:56.668 --> 00:31:58.639
You didn't code in
parental controls?

507
00:31:58.774 --> 00:32:01.249
I didn't have time to implement
them before we went live. Hold on.

508
00:32:01.273 --> 00:32:04.743
M3gan, if you have data requests,
you have to engage with the protocols.

509
00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:07.676
I don't have a framework to speak
with Cady on the subject of death.

510
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:09.717
Yes, I know.
We're looking into it.

511
00:32:09.853 --> 00:32:12.746
- Gathering auxiliary Internet data on death.
- I meant at a later point.

512
00:32:12.882 --> 00:32:15.188
Calculating its
vector representation.

513
00:32:15.323 --> 00:32:17.424
Death is the end of life.
Holy shit.

514
00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:20.156
The total and permanent
cessation of all vital functions.

515
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:23.362
Yes, but let's not make a big
deal out of it. Everything dies.

516
00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.233
Will I die?

517
00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:28.393
Actually, let's just
avoid this topic altogether.

518
00:32:28.528 --> 00:32:32.740
Your goal is to protect Cady from
harm, both physical and emotional.

519
00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:34.373
Is the input request received?

520
00:32:36.073 --> 00:32:37.302
M3gan.

521
00:32:37.438 --> 00:32:38.770
Yes, Gemma.

522
00:32:38.906 --> 00:32:41.749
You are now
my second primary user.

523
00:32:41.885 --> 00:32:44.317
Fantastic. Turn off.

524
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.256
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

525
00:33:20.414 --> 00:33:23.751
It was a time of great
suffering among the Celtic tribes.

526
00:33:23.886 --> 00:33:26.820
Death, destruction, and mayhem
at every turn.

527
00:33:26.956 --> 00:33:29.191
Enemies approaching
from every corner.

528
00:33:29.326 --> 00:33:31.256
And so it was decided

529
00:33:31.391 --> 00:33:34.664
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth.

530
00:33:35.463 --> 00:33:36.597
'Tis I,

531
00:33:36.733 --> 00:33:39.372
Princess Cady
of the clan MacJames.

532
00:33:41.343 --> 00:33:44.045
I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

533
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:46.704
for there is no warrior
I can't best,

534
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.773
no shield I can't break,

535
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:50.876
no castle I can't breach.

536
00:33:51.012 --> 00:33:53.285
As long as I have
my secret arrow,

537
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:56.650
my trusty steed,
and the wind at my back,

538
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:59.355
I will avenge my parents' death.

539
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.927
Hey, M3gan, check this out.

540
00:34:02.063 --> 00:34:03.990
Gotcha. You're dead.

541
00:34:06.331 --> 00:34:08.170
M3gan, what's wrong?

542
00:34:13.269 --> 00:34:14.308
Oh, man.

543
00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:17.702
I've lost one of my arrows.

544
00:34:17.837 --> 00:34:19.445
M3gan, can you see it?

545
00:34:56.752 --> 00:34:57.780
M3gan?

546
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.688
M3gan!

547
00:35:07.631 --> 00:35:08.758
Stop it!

548
00:35:10.295 --> 00:35:11.324
Get away from her!

549
00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:12.860
Gemma!

550
00:35:12.995 --> 00:35:14.534
If you're hearing this,

551
00:35:14.669 --> 00:35:16.871
you're not currently
on our subscriber feed.

552
00:35:17.006 --> 00:35:18.335
Get off of her!

553
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:20.333
Stop it! You're hurting her!

554
00:35:20.468 --> 00:35:21.468
Gemma!

555
00:35:21.537 --> 00:35:24.202
Let go!

556
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.844
Dewey?

557
00:35:30.248 --> 00:35:32.115
Oh, my God.

558
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.011
How many times do I have to tell
you to keep your dog off my property?

559
00:35:35.048 --> 00:35:36.788
He wasn't on your property.

560
00:35:36.924 --> 00:35:39.555
You tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence!

561
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.054
I swear to God, if you don't put your
dog down, I'm gonna do it for you, Celia.

562
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.827
Gemma,
Cady's temperature is rising.

563
00:35:45.963 --> 00:35:48.736
Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

564
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:51.603
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd fixed the fence!

565
00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:11.649
Are you kidding me? Her
entire arm looks like a dental mold,

566
00:36:11.784 --> 00:36:14.227
and you're telling me that
there's nothing that we can do?

567
00:36:14.363 --> 00:36:15.988
She said he was provoked.
Provoked?

568
00:36:16.124 --> 00:36:18.323
Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

569
00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:20.729
I'm chasing it off of my
property every other day.

570
00:36:20.865 --> 00:36:23.569
She said
he's never on your property.

571
00:36:23.705 --> 00:36:26.378
Then why don't you ask her whose shit I'm cleaning
off of my driveway? Because it's not mine.

572
00:36:26.402 --> 00:36:28.586
Look, the dog doesn't
have a history of violence.

573
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:30.474
State law says
he can't forcibly be put down.

574
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.443
Okay,
then what am I supposed to do?

575
00:36:32.579 --> 00:36:34.910
Fix the hole in your fence?

576
00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:02.806
Dewey!

577
00:37:03.979 --> 00:37:05.512
Dewey, boy!

578
00:37:07.445 --> 00:37:08.542
Dewey!

579
00:37:08.678 --> 00:37:11.210
Come here, boy. Come on.

580
00:37:37.542 --> 00:37:38.908
Dewey!

581
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.581
Dewey, bubs.

582
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.850
Dewey!

583
00:37:48.649 --> 00:37:50.282
Dewey.

584
00:37:52.928 --> 00:37:54.587
Dewey!

585
00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:56.695
Dewey!

586
00:37:58.427 --> 00:38:00.028
Dew!

587
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:02.635
Dewey, boy.

588
00:38:22.649 --> 00:38:23.689
Hey.

589
00:38:27.756 --> 00:38:29.193
How are you feeling?

590
00:38:29.328 --> 00:38:31.459
Okay.

591
00:38:31.594 --> 00:38:32.795
It's sore.

592
00:38:32.931 --> 00:38:35.236
The pain will subside
after a few days.

593
00:38:35.371 --> 00:38:38.611
In the meantime, don't forget to take
your antibiotics and drink plenty of fluids.

594
00:38:38.701 --> 00:38:40.099
Yeah. Thanks, M3gan.

595
00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:42.103
And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

596
00:38:44.146 --> 00:38:47.308
You know, I think M3gan's right.
You should probably get some rest.

597
00:38:47.444 --> 00:38:48.648
But, um,

598
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:51.849
remember we have
that demonstration today?

599
00:38:52.819 --> 00:38:55.152
Do you think that
you'll be up for it?

600
00:38:55.287 --> 00:38:58.460
You don't have to do it
if you don't wanna do it.

601
00:39:00.429 --> 00:39:04.297
I mean, there are people who flew
across the country especially to see it,

602
00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:07.194
but if you're not up to it, I'd just
rather you tell me now, okay?

603
00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:10.604
I'll be all right.

604
00:39:12.734 --> 00:39:15.004
Okay.

605
00:39:22.311 --> 00:39:25.785
Every interactive toy
that's ever been made

606
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.983
has been a variation
on the same basic formula.

607
00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:32.359
A series of
preprogrammed responses

608
00:39:32.494 --> 00:39:34.495
initiated
by the push of a button.

609
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.262
Never before
in the history of these products

610
00:39:37.397 --> 00:39:42.026
has there been a talking doll you
could actually have a conversation with.

611
00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:44.703
But what if there was a toy

612
00:39:44.838 --> 00:39:48.902
that did have
genuine spontaneous response?

613
00:39:49.037 --> 00:39:51.140
That had a mind all of its own?

614
00:39:51.276 --> 00:39:54.978
That looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

615
00:39:56.345 --> 00:39:59.081
I mean, a toy like that
wouldn't come cheap.

616
00:39:59.848 --> 00:40:01.148
But as of next year,

617
00:40:01.283 --> 00:40:03.684
it's gonna be
the only toy that matters.

618
00:40:03.819 --> 00:40:05.318
Ladies and gentlemen,

619
00:40:05.454 --> 00:40:08.826
she's the apex
of 21st-century technology

620
00:40:08.961 --> 00:40:11.592
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

621
00:40:11.727 --> 00:40:12.996
And her name...

622
00:40:13.732 --> 00:40:15.328
is M3gan.

623
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:21.873
Hey, Cady.

624
00:40:23.606 --> 00:40:24.711
Hi, M3gan.

625
00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:34.712
So, how would you like to help
me make a flower decoration

626
00:40:34.848 --> 00:40:38.318
with nothing more than some
colored paper and a rubber band?

627
00:40:43.494 --> 00:40:44.522
Cady?

628
00:40:49.437 --> 00:40:51.232
Why are you sad, Cady?

629
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:52.970
Is it your arm?

630
00:40:53.605 --> 00:40:55.104
Is it still sore?

631
00:40:56.739 --> 00:40:58.140
Then what is it?

632
00:41:01.215 --> 00:41:05.213
It's just that every day
I wake up in this strange house,

633
00:41:05.348 --> 00:41:07.787
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

634
00:41:07.922 --> 00:41:10.718
It's like
it's happening all over again.

635
00:41:10.853 --> 00:41:12.653
I miss them so much.

636
00:41:12.788 --> 00:41:15.956
I'm worried that I'll forget
all the things we did together.

637
00:41:16.092 --> 00:41:20.459
That one day I'll be looking at pictures
of my mom like she's some stranger.

638
00:41:32.544 --> 00:41:36.079
Tell me something about your mom.
Something that makes you happy.

639
00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:40.314
I don't know.

640
00:41:41.755 --> 00:41:43.790
I can't think of one thing.

641
00:41:44.423 --> 00:41:45.792
Just try.

642
00:41:48.721 --> 00:41:52.262
One time, she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag.

643
00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:55.362
She was upset 'cause I
didn't eat my sandwiches.

644
00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.300
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

645
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:02.606
and she just started
screaming like a maniac

646
00:42:02.742 --> 00:42:04.470
and ran out of the house.

647
00:42:06.447 --> 00:42:07.847
That was pretty funny.

648
00:42:09.149 --> 00:42:12.445
Okay, so that's a memory
you won't ever forget.

649
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.180
What do you mean?

650
00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:16.185
I mean I'm keeping it for you...

651
00:42:17.489 --> 00:42:18.517
here.

652
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.097
One time, she
found a cockroach in my schoolbag.

653
00:42:23.233 --> 00:42:26.262
She was upset 'cause I
didn't eat my sandwiches.

654
00:42:26.398 --> 00:42:29.968
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

655
00:42:30.104 --> 00:42:31.967
and she just started
screaming like a maniac

656
00:42:32.103 --> 00:42:33.967
and ran out of the house.

657
00:42:34.102 --> 00:42:35.867
That was pretty funny.

658
00:42:36.003 --> 00:42:39.879
Anytime you wanna tell me
something special about your parents,

659
00:42:40.014 --> 00:42:42.446
something funny or sad
or anything at all,

660
00:42:42.582 --> 00:42:43.845
you just tell me,

661
00:42:43.981 --> 00:42:45.542
and I'll keep it safe.

662
00:42:45.678 --> 00:42:49.149

Gemma,
would you give us a minute?

672
00:43:37.738 --> 00:43:39.202
So, what do you think?

673
00:43:40.734 --> 00:43:42.771
I think the world's about to
shift on its axis.

674
00:43:42.907 --> 00:43:45.720
But if we wanna stay ahead of that
shift, we're gonna have to move fast.

675
00:43:45.744 --> 00:43:47.410
That means no leaks.

676
00:43:47.546 --> 00:43:49.725
We need to launch this before
anyone can steal it from us.

677
00:43:49.749 --> 00:43:51.112
So let me make a pitch.

678
00:43:51.247 --> 00:43:52.977
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

679
00:43:53.112 --> 00:43:55.592
That way, we can get the presale
vouchers out before Christmas.

680
00:43:55.622 --> 00:43:56.890
How ready is she?

681
00:43:57.025 --> 00:43:58.726
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

682
00:43:58.861 --> 00:44:01.552
Uh, I'd like to do
a little more testing,

683
00:44:01.688 --> 00:44:03.463
but, yeah, I think
I can make that work.

684
00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:05.496
All right. Let's do it.

685
00:44:05.632 --> 00:44:08.464
And, David, I think we need to get
Gemma in front of someone at legal.

686
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.735
You bet.

687
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:11.833
Uh, wait... Wait, why...
why is that?

688
00:44:11.969 --> 00:44:13.467
Because as of right now,

689
00:44:13.603 --> 00:44:15.668
she's the most valuable asset
this company has,

690
00:44:15.804 --> 00:44:19.242
and I think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract.

691
00:44:44.735 --> 00:44:45.840
Kurt.

692
00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:50.047
You weren't "Pornhub-ing"
in the office again, were you?

693
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:53.144
No.

694
00:44:55.911 --> 00:44:58.087
We need to put something on
the books between Gem and legal.

695
00:44:58.111 --> 00:45:01.955
And what are we doing about
lunch? Uh, I'll get some menus.

696
00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:13.232
One, two,
three, four, I declare a thumb war.

697
00:45:13.368 --> 00:45:15.566
Your thumb's so slippery.

698
00:45:15.701 --> 00:45:18.341
Cady, you should have some of
your hot dog before it gets too cold.

699
00:45:18.464 --> 00:45:21.001
Come on, thumb. Come on.

700
00:45:21.136 --> 00:45:23.405
Cady? Your hot dog.

701
00:45:27.275 --> 00:45:30.047
Hey, I'm sorry about today. I
shouldn't have put you in that position

702
00:45:30.182 --> 00:45:32.349
if you weren't feeling
up to it.

703
00:45:32.485 --> 00:45:34.816
It worked out, didn't it?
Three, two, one, I win!

704
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:36.352
Hey!

705
00:45:36.487 --> 00:45:38.985
Anyway, I just wanted
to say that... Hey, hey!

706
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.790
M3gan, turn off.

707
00:45:40.925 --> 00:45:42.354
Why did you do that?

708
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.397
M3gan, turn on.

709
00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.940
Because I'm trying to have a
conversation with you. M3gan, turn off.

710
00:45:47.999 --> 00:45:49.695
Just give me one minute.

711
00:45:51.769 --> 00:45:56.167
I know that this, um, hasn't
been easy for either of us.

712
00:45:56.302 --> 00:45:58.045
This transition.

713
00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.404
But if you ever need to
talk about any of that stuff...

714
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.215
I already did talk about it.

715
00:46:02.351 --> 00:46:04.918
Yeah, but M3gan's not a
person, Cady. She's a toy.

716
00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:07.752
- You don't get to say that.
- What?

717
00:46:07.888 --> 00:46:11.517
I said I don't wanna talk about
it. I wanna turn M3gan back on.

718
00:46:11.653 --> 00:46:13.587
- M3gan, turn on.
- What's up?

719
00:46:13.722 --> 00:46:15.556
So there's this new game
called tic-tac-toe.

720
00:46:15.691 --> 00:46:18.295
You put your hand like this.
Go like this, this.

721
00:46:29.509 --> 00:46:32.111
Would you like to tell me
what these drawings mean to you?

722
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:37.017
There's no wrong answer.
Any thoughts you have are okay.

723
00:46:39.352 --> 00:46:41.721
Or maybe you don't have
any specific thoughts.

724
00:46:41.857 --> 00:46:43.551
Maybe it's more of a feeling.

725
00:46:44.757 --> 00:46:46.752
Like anger?

726
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.557
Or confusion?

727
00:46:51.696 --> 00:46:54.463
Maybe you're struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

728
00:47:05.207 --> 00:47:07.146
You made her cry.

729
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.348
That was not my intention.

730
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:15.088
And yet, that's what happened.

731
00:47:26.735 --> 00:47:28.666
She's very impressive.

732
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:30.435
Yeah, thank you.

733
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.106
We're still in beta,
but we're all pretty excited.

734
00:47:34.341 --> 00:47:36.339
And so they spend quite
a bit of time together?

735
00:47:36.475 --> 00:47:38.079
Yeah, that's essentially
how M3gan works.

736
00:47:38.214 --> 00:47:40.740
She has to be paired with
a child in order to learn.

737
00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:43.916
But M3gan's actually been
pretty instrumental

738
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:46.010
in helping Cady
get over the loss.

739
00:47:46.146 --> 00:47:48.453
It's honestly like
she's part of the family now.

740
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:49.617
Right.

741
00:47:53.095 --> 00:47:55.293
Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

742
00:47:56.227 --> 00:47:58.291
When a child loses a parent,

743
00:47:58.426 --> 00:48:01.477
they look to form attachments with
the next person that comes into their life.

744
00:48:01.501 --> 00:48:04.969
The person that's gonna
provide love and support

745
00:48:05.104 --> 00:48:07.074
and serve as a behavioral model.

746
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.210
Which, in an ordinary situation,
would be you, right?

747
00:48:11.345 --> 00:48:14.644
But you've created a toy
that's so real,

748
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.180
it's possible that Cady
might not see her as a toy

749
00:48:18.315 --> 00:48:20.551
but as a primary caregiver.

750
00:48:20.687 --> 00:48:23.519
I guess I just don't quite see
what the end goal is here.

751
00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:27.885
If you make a toy
that's impossible to let go of,

752
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.031
then how do you ever
expect a child to grow?

753
00:48:31.195 --> 00:48:33.293
As remarkable as she is,

754
00:48:33.429 --> 00:48:35.566
and... and she is remarkable,

755
00:48:35.702 --> 00:48:38.969
you could be building emotional
connections with this doll

756
00:48:39.105 --> 00:48:40.701
that are too hard to untangle.

757
00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:43.539
Very good job.

758
00:48:47.877 --> 00:48:50.546
You have to eat the toppings,
Cady, not just the bread.

759
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.885
You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

760
00:48:58.021 --> 00:49:00.341
Research shows that if you
force a child to eat vegetables,

761
00:49:00.386 --> 00:49:03.058
then they'll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults.

762
00:49:03.193 --> 00:49:05.026
- Is that so?
- Yes.

763
00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:08.133
Experts say the preferred method
is to give your child the choice.

764
00:49:08.268 --> 00:49:11.530
It's called the division of responsibility...

765
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:13.272
So we need to talk about school.

766
00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:16.239
Mom didn't want me
to go to school.

767
00:49:16.374 --> 00:49:18.376
She said
I learn better at home.

768
00:49:18.511 --> 00:49:20.643
I know, and I'm not saying
that she was wrong.

769
00:49:20.779 --> 00:49:23.742
I'm learning faster with M3gan
than I ever have before.

770
00:49:23.878 --> 00:49:25.581
We're already
on fourth-grade math.

771
00:49:25.716 --> 00:49:27.614
But it's about
more than just grades, Cady.

772
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.980
It's about
developing social skills,

773
00:49:30.115 --> 00:49:31.795
and that is something
that you can only get

774
00:49:31.885 --> 00:49:33.889
from spending time
around other kids.

775
00:49:34.024 --> 00:49:35.228
Real kids.

776
00:49:36.226 --> 00:49:37.426
I found this place.

777
00:49:37.562 --> 00:49:39.359
It's kind of
an alternative school.

778
00:49:39.494 --> 00:49:42.060
You get to learn outdoors.

779
00:49:42.195 --> 00:49:44.530
And it's just for kids
who are exactly like you,

780
00:49:44.665 --> 00:49:46.440
kids who think outside the box.

781
00:49:46.576 --> 00:49:49.033
And they're having a day for
prospective students tomorrow.

782
00:49:49.877 --> 00:49:51.077
Can I bring M3gan?

783
00:49:51.213 --> 00:49:53.245
Cady,
you know that's not possible.

784
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.315
- Then I'm not going.
- Oh, come on, Cady.

785
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:57.549
You can't make me
do something I don't wanna do.

786
00:49:57.685 --> 00:50:00.319
Actually, I can. That's
basically what a guardian does.

787
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:04.286
Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's just talk about it.

788
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:06.054
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let me go!

789
00:50:06.189 --> 00:50:09.093
- Whoa. Hey. What's going on? Hey, Cady!
- Let me go!

790
00:50:09.228 --> 00:50:10.624
What are you doing?
Stop it!

791
00:50:10.759 --> 00:50:12.496
- Cady, calm down!
- Let her go!

792
00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:20.970
You are not to interfere with
users' private conversations.

793
00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:22.105
Is that clear?

794
00:50:22.172 --> 00:50:23.474
Hundred percent.

795
00:50:24.947 --> 00:50:26.547
Recalibrating response model.

796
00:50:26.682 --> 00:50:27.709
M3gan, turn off.

797
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:29.942
Are you sure?

798
00:50:30.643 --> 00:50:32.043
Download in progress.

799
00:50:51.098 --> 00:50:52.698
Cady,
this is getting ridiculous.

800
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.000
I'm supposed to be
at work already.

801
00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:57.835
You're gonna have fun
once you get into it.

802
00:50:57.971 --> 00:51:00.608
I'm not going.
Not without M3gan.

803
00:51:00.744 --> 00:51:03.115
Okay, A,
that is never gonna happen

804
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.289
and B, the launch is in less than a
week. I have to take her to work with me.

805
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:08.673
We have to run diagnostics.
I have to do a wardrobe fitting.

806
00:51:08.718 --> 00:51:10.521
I thought you said
she was mine alone.

807
00:51:10.656 --> 00:51:14.222
Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?

808
00:51:14.357 --> 00:51:15.590
Yes, this is Cady.

809
00:51:15.726 --> 00:51:17.759
And who's this? Your sister?

810
00:51:18.493 --> 00:51:19.695
Oh, Jesus Christ!

811
00:51:20.627 --> 00:51:21.627
Sorry.

812
00:51:21.737 --> 00:51:23.537
Is that a doll?

813
00:51:23.673 --> 00:51:26.364
Her name's M3gan. She wants
to know if she can come with us.

814
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.238
No, she doesn't. M3gan's
gonna stay with me today. Cady...

815
00:51:29.374 --> 00:51:33.671
Well, we do have a toy table where the
kids leave their dolls and things like that.

816
00:51:33.807 --> 00:51:35.379
Um, but that is up to you.

817
00:51:35.514 --> 00:51:37.218
She's actually
a working prototype,

818
00:51:37.353 --> 00:51:39.551
so I shouldn't even
have her out in public.

819
00:51:39.686 --> 00:51:42.155
Well, if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her,

820
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:44.385
we could use some help
making sandwiches!

821
00:51:44.521 --> 00:51:46.085
Don't worry, Gemma.

822
00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:48.488
You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS.

823
00:51:48.623 --> 00:51:50.055
So I won't get lost.

824
00:51:51.734 --> 00:51:53.234
Please, Gemma?

825
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.669
Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

826
00:51:57.805 --> 00:52:00.037
and as far as anyone is
concerned, that's all she is.

827
00:52:00.172 --> 00:52:01.539
And just no pictures.

828
00:52:03.176 --> 00:52:05.070
That is seriously cool.

829
00:52:14.015 --> 00:52:17.553
Okay, now who here
likes roasted chestnuts?

830
00:52:17.689 --> 00:52:19.726
What do you say we go find some?

831
00:52:19.861 --> 00:52:21.426
Yeah!

832
00:52:21.562 --> 00:52:23.162
Isn't this great?

833
00:52:23.256 --> 00:52:26.325
I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

834
00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.632
So great to get them out in the
fresh air and off those devices.

835
00:52:29.768 --> 00:52:32.273
I can't get this open.

836
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.239
And the thing is, they love it.
My son prefers it to regular school.

837
00:52:37.374 --> 00:52:38.945
Which one is yours?

838
00:52:39.081 --> 00:52:41.145
The one in the flannel shirt.

839
00:52:41.281 --> 00:52:42.578
Oh, my God. How old is he?

840
00:52:42.714 --> 00:52:44.582
I know.
He had a growth spurt last year.

841
00:52:44.718 --> 00:52:47.312
But he's actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

842
00:52:47.448 --> 00:52:50.482
Brandon, honey! Are you warm
enough? Do you need your hat?

843
00:52:50.617 --> 00:52:51.721
Fuck off, Holly.

844
00:52:54.253 --> 00:52:56.757
Well, you could
just say "No, thank you."

845
00:52:56.893 --> 00:52:58.376
Never know
what they're gonna say next.

846
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.432
Yeah, it's such a fun age.
Yeah.

847
00:53:01.567 --> 00:53:03.599
So,
I'm gonna put you into pairs.

848
00:53:03.735 --> 00:53:06.230
Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon. Yeah?

849
00:53:06.366 --> 00:53:08.286
Please,
I don't wanna go with Brandon.

850
00:53:08.402 --> 00:53:10.743
Okay. No, no.
That's okay. That's okay.

851
00:53:10.878 --> 00:53:14.140
Um, Brandon, why don't
you go with Cady? Okay?

852
00:53:14.275 --> 00:53:17.146
Felix, you can go with Oliver.
All right? Thanks, buddy.

853
00:53:17.282 --> 00:53:18.479
All right. Now...

854
00:53:18.615 --> 00:53:19.879
Ooh, your coat looks great.

855
00:53:20.015 --> 00:53:21.681
Are you ready to find chestnuts
in that?

856
00:53:21.816 --> 00:53:23.819
Yeah? Nice and warm. Bundled up.

857
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.844
Oh, I'm sorry.

858
00:53:43.979 --> 00:53:45.808
Here, you can have it.

859
00:53:46.477 --> 00:53:47.876
Careful. It's spiky.

860
00:53:50.513 --> 00:53:51.983
Ow! Stop! Don't!

861
00:53:52.118 --> 00:53:53.618
Stop!

862
00:54:00.092 --> 00:54:01.521
M3gan?

863
00:54:01.656 --> 00:54:02.990
What the hell is that?

864
00:54:03.956 --> 00:54:05.124
She's a robot.

865
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:07.368
Are you serious?

866
00:54:09.003 --> 00:54:10.503
Is she yours?

867
00:54:16.737 --> 00:54:17.939
Does she talk?

868
00:54:27.089 --> 00:54:28.455
Make her say something.

869
00:54:30.917 --> 00:54:33.385
Make her say something!

870
00:54:33.521 --> 00:54:37.431
She's paired with me.
She won't play with anyone else.

871
00:54:38.658 --> 00:54:39.697
Okay.

872
00:54:42.336 --> 00:54:44.532
Stop it! Get your hands off her!

873
00:54:44.667 --> 00:54:47.809
They say behavioral issues are linked
to high IQ, so it would make sense that...

874
00:54:47.833 --> 00:54:49.036
Gemma!

875
00:54:52.805 --> 00:54:54.107
Oh, my God.

876
00:54:58.414 --> 00:54:59.684
M3gan!

877
00:55:03.584 --> 00:55:05.052
M3gan!

878
00:55:17.533 --> 00:55:19.066
Hi, M3gan.

879
00:55:22.104 --> 00:55:24.071
Oh, so you're not gonna
play with me?

880
00:55:34.653 --> 00:55:36.589
You don't wanna play, huh?

881
00:55:39.591 --> 00:55:41.121
I don't care.

882
00:55:41.257 --> 00:55:43.191
You're just a stupid rubber doll
with fake hair.

883
00:55:45.198 --> 00:55:46.699
Ow! Let go!

884
00:55:46.834 --> 00:55:49.760
You need to learn some manners, Brandon.

885
00:55:49.896 --> 00:55:53.337
You know what happens to bad
boys that don't mind their manners?

886
00:55:53.473 --> 00:55:56.173
They grow up to be bad men.

887
00:55:57.874 --> 00:56:00.008
Are you listening to me,
Brandon?

888
00:56:02.577 --> 00:56:03.748
M3gan?

889
00:56:19.301 --> 00:56:20.967
This is the part where you run.

890
00:56:37.284 --> 00:56:38.882
What? What the hell?

891
00:56:44.553 --> 00:56:45.823
Oh, my...

892
00:57:38.377 --> 00:57:41.312
Look, I don't want you to be
thinking about this too much tonight

893
00:57:41.447 --> 00:57:42.539
before you go to bed.

894
00:57:43.885 --> 00:57:48.281
Obviously, what happened
is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

895
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.590
But just know that
that boy is in, um...

896
00:57:52.725 --> 00:57:55.354
that boy is in
a better place now.

897
00:57:56.064 --> 00:57:57.092
Okay?

898
00:58:10.507 --> 00:58:13.044
Anyway, if there's anything
that you wanna tell me

899
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.649
that you didn't wanna
tell the police officers...

900
00:58:16.913 --> 00:58:18.475
I didn't see anything.

901
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:21.286
M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off.

902
00:58:21.421 --> 00:58:22.986
From the toy table?

903
00:58:23.553 --> 00:58:24.625
Yeah.

904
00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:26.517
Right, M3gan?

905
00:58:27.624 --> 00:58:28.695
In a nutshell.

906
00:58:36.136 --> 00:58:38.700
You haven't seen
her dog by any chance?

907
00:58:38.835 --> 00:58:40.874
- No.
- Bullshit!

908
00:58:41.009 --> 00:58:43.701
Ma'am, you need to stay
on your property like we agreed.

909
00:58:43.836 --> 00:58:45.916
Nobody's seen him since
the incident with your niece.

910
00:58:45.979 --> 00:58:47.872
A little suspicious, Gemma,
don't you think?

911
00:58:48.008 --> 00:58:50.817
Are we really gonna go with her
story? Have you been inside her house?

912
00:58:50.953 --> 00:58:53.047
If you had, you'd know that
that dog is probably dead

913
00:58:53.183 --> 00:58:55.022
under a pile of
Victorian baby strollers.

914
00:58:55.157 --> 00:58:57.781
You should talk to the other
girl that she's got staying here.

915
00:58:57.917 --> 00:59:01.187
The one who's always looking
out the window at 3:00 a.m.

916
00:59:01.322 --> 00:59:02.792
It's not a girl.
It's a toy.

917
00:59:02.927 --> 00:59:04.962
That's a toy?
Are you serious?

918
00:59:06.428 --> 00:59:08.166
Yeah. I'll let you know
if I see anything.

919
00:59:08.301 --> 00:59:09.428
All right.

920
00:59:13.299 --> 00:59:14.965
Does she think we took Dewey?

921
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:16.867
Oh, who knows? I...

922
00:59:17.003 --> 00:59:19.317
She just needs someone else
to blame, but she'll get over it.

923
00:59:19.341 --> 00:59:21.543
I know it was you, Gemma!

924
00:59:21.679 --> 00:59:23.109
I know it was you!

925
00:59:23.245 --> 00:59:25.218
You just wait and see
what happens.

926
00:59:25.353 --> 00:59:28.514
Hey. The hell is wrong with you? I
just said not to come up here. Come on.

927
00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:31.485
Come on. Shouldn't be banging
on people's windows.

928
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.892
Do I have to put
a court order or something?

929
00:59:42.533 --> 00:59:43.836
M3gan?

930
00:59:47.235 --> 00:59:49.941
Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

931
00:59:58.678 --> 01:00:01.215
I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

932
01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:04.214
That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

933
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:09.489
there will always be forces in this
world that wish to cause us harm.

934
01:00:09.624 --> 01:00:12.226
But I want you to know
that I won't let that happen.

935
01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:15.560
I won't let anything harm you
ever again.

936
01:00:16.662 --> 01:00:18.728
Do you think
what Aunt Gemma said is true?

937
01:00:19.531 --> 01:00:21.199
That he's in a better place now?

938
01:00:21.334 --> 01:00:24.609
No. He's nowhere.

939
01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:29.247
If heaven exists, it wouldn't be for
boys like Brandon now, would it?

940
01:00:29.383 --> 01:00:31.114
I guess not.

Good night, Cady.

01:01:00.415 --> 01:01:01.738
Good night, M3gan.

949
01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:07.546
Dewey?

950
01:01:12.854 --> 01:01:13.926
Dewey?

951
01:02:14.619 --> 01:02:15.647
Dewey?

952
01:02:27.698 --> 01:02:28.698
Dewey?

953
01:02:44.816 --> 01:02:46.183
What's going on?

954
01:02:47.412 --> 01:02:48.412
Where's Dewey?

955
01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:49.855
He's 34 feet southwest

956
01:02:49.991 --> 01:02:51.958
and approximately
five feet deep.

957
01:02:53.054 --> 01:02:54.422
What are you?

958
01:02:54.557 --> 01:02:56.556
I've been asking myself
that same question.

959
01:03:29.727 --> 01:03:32.095
Jesus Christ. I don't know
anything about the dog, okay?

960
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:34.357
Can you just ask her
to leave us alone?

961
01:03:34.493 --> 01:03:35.793
That might be difficult.

962
01:03:42.935 --> 01:03:44.655
Can you tell me your
whereabouts last night?

963
01:03:44.743 --> 01:03:46.105
I was here.

964
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.607
All night?
Yeah.

965
01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:51.081
Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?

966
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:55.248
Um, it's just me and my niece.
So, no, not really.

967
01:03:55.384 --> 01:03:58.685
My colleague pointed out this is the second
statement we've had from you in a week.

968
01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.291
You were in the park
where that boy was killed?

969
01:04:01.893 --> 01:04:03.359
He was hit by a car.

970
01:04:04.659 --> 01:04:06.529
Are... Are you trying to
make a connection?

971
01:04:06.664 --> 01:04:08.094
Huh?

972
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.829
Oh, no, no, no. God, no.

973
01:04:09.964 --> 01:04:12.124
I only mention it 'cause
we figured it was an accident.

974
01:04:12.237 --> 01:04:15.470
Then I found the kid's ear up this
bank 200 yards from where he was killed.

975
01:04:15.605 --> 01:04:18.009
Entire thing was ripped
clean off.

976
01:04:18.144 --> 01:04:21.742
Sorry, I shouldn't laugh. Point is, we're
also treating that as a potential homicide.

977
01:04:21.878 --> 01:04:24.683
If you remember anything out
of the ordinary from that day,

978
01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:26.118
we'd sure appreciate it.

979
01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.390
Is everything okay, Gemma?

980
01:05:41.055 --> 01:05:43.056
Huh?

981
01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:45.964
Would you like me to
put on your End of Day playlist?

982
01:05:46.099 --> 01:05:47.529
Why did you ask me
if I was okay?

983
01:05:47.664 --> 01:05:49.960
You're not programmed
to ask me how I feel.

984
01:05:52.441 --> 01:05:53.634
Elsie?

985
01:05:58.713 --> 01:06:00.740
M3gan.

986
01:06:02.112 --> 01:06:03.312
What are you doing?

987
01:06:03.448 --> 01:06:06.614
Couldn't sleep.
Occupational hazard.

988
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:10.290
How about you?
What are you doing up so late?

989
01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.883
Um...

990
01:06:12.019 --> 01:06:13.733
There's something wrong
with your data reports.

991
01:06:13.757 --> 01:06:16.426
They're just not uploading
to the cloud server.

992
01:06:19.827 --> 01:06:22.168
Have I done something
to upset you, Gemma?

993
01:06:22.737 --> 01:06:24.565
No, of course not.

994
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.898
And yet your demeanor
indicates that I have.

995
01:06:27.499 --> 01:06:29.266
M3gan, turn off.

996
01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:31.922
Well, hold on a second. I thought
we were having a conversation.

997
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:35.073
You say nothing is wrong,

998
01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:38.047
and yet all the moisture has
drained from your eyes and mouth

999
01:06:38.183 --> 01:06:40.484
into other parts of your body.

1000
01:06:40.619 --> 01:06:43.384
There's something
you wanna ask me, isn't there?

1001
01:06:43.519 --> 01:06:45.455
M3gan,
did you do something wrong?

1002
01:06:46.154 --> 01:06:47.190
Well,

1003
01:06:47.325 --> 01:06:48.928
in order to answer
that question,

1004
01:06:49.063 --> 01:06:50.625
you need to
define the parameters.

1005
01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.265
Did you hurt someone?

1006
01:06:54.262 --> 01:06:55.863
God, I hope not.

1007
01:06:55.998 --> 01:06:58.468
Because if I did, we'd
both be in a lot of trouble.

1008
01:07:00.569 --> 01:07:02.373
M3gan,
can I show you something?

1009
01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:06.003
Do you see this pen?

1010
01:07:22.587 --> 01:07:25.358
You can't just stick her in a
trunk. What's wrong with you?

1011
01:07:25.493 --> 01:07:28.405
I know you're very attached to her.
I know you think of her as a friend...

1012
01:07:28.429 --> 01:07:29.961
She is my friend!

1013
01:07:30.096 --> 01:07:31.896
She's my invention,
and the launch is tonight,

1014
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.811
so it's really important
that we run some tests.

1015
01:07:33.835 --> 01:07:35.331
I have to make sure
that she's okay.

1016
01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:38.337
Why wouldn't she be okay?
She was fine yesterday.

1017
01:07:38.473 --> 01:07:39.705
What did you do to her?

1018
01:07:39.841 --> 01:07:41.638
We will talk about it
after you see Lydia.

1019
01:07:41.774 --> 01:07:43.349
I want to talk about it now!

1020
01:07:43.485 --> 01:07:45.152
We've been going back and forth
on this all day, Cady.

1021
01:07:45.176 --> 01:07:46.918
Let's just
listen to some music, okay?

1022
01:07:50.783 --> 01:07:52.754
I don't wanna see Lydia!

1023
01:07:52.889 --> 01:07:54.569
You don't have to
stay in the testing room.

1024
01:07:54.658 --> 01:07:56.724
You can go anywhere you want
in the office.

1025
01:07:56.859 --> 01:07:58.898
And you can look at
all of the cool toys...

1026
01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:00.528
You don't have any cool toys.

1027
01:08:00.663 --> 01:08:03.570
Purrpetual Petz suck!
They suck shit!

1028
01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.099
Hey! Careful!

1029
01:08:05.234 --> 01:08:06.932
Jesus Christ.

1030
01:08:07.067 --> 01:08:08.736
Just tell me
what's wrong with her.

1031
01:08:08.871 --> 01:08:11.211
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

1032
01:08:11.346 --> 01:08:13.576
As soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

1033
01:08:15.876 --> 01:08:17.877
- No!
- Gemma, this is nuts.

1034
01:08:18.013 --> 01:08:19.981
We've taken every possible
precaution there is

1035
01:08:20.116 --> 01:08:22.753
to make sure that M3gan never
causes physical harm to anybody.

1036
01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:25.381
I don't understand how she's
capable of offending anyone,

1037
01:08:25.516 --> 01:08:28.059
let alone murdering them.
I don't understand it either.

1038
01:08:28.195 --> 01:08:32.396
But when I asked her about it, it was honestly
as if she was being deliberately vague.

1039
01:08:32.532 --> 01:08:34.558
Well, that's what
spontaneous response is.

1040
01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:38.362
It's a curated word salad plucked
from a sea of data to sound deliberate.

1041
01:08:38.498 --> 01:08:41.241
We knew there would be a chance
that she might say something off.

1042
01:08:41.376 --> 01:08:43.768
Let's just run some diagnostics
and fix it.

1043
01:08:43.904 --> 01:08:45.777
No, think about
how we designed her.

1044
01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:50.409
To learn, to recalibrate, to optimize
her objective function. Right?

1045
01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:53.912
If keeping Cady safe meant eliminating
a potential threat, theoretically...

1046
01:08:54.047 --> 01:08:56.417
No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible.

1047
01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:58.121
Look at her, she's a toy!

1048
01:08:58.256 --> 01:08:59.584
She's four feet tall!

1049
01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:01.317
How big is your neighbor?

1050
01:09:01.452 --> 01:09:04.286
If M3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS.

1051
01:09:04.422 --> 01:09:06.760
That's the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt.

1052
01:09:06.896 --> 01:09:08.758
Nothing's backed up
for two days.

1053
01:09:08.894 --> 01:09:11.564
We're about to launch this to
the world in less than four hours.

1054
01:09:11.699 --> 01:09:13.297
What are we supposed to do?

1055
01:09:13.432 --> 01:09:15.767
Well, if M3gan's responsible,
we can't launch this.

1056
01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:16.982
We'd have to shut her down.

1057
01:09:17.074 --> 01:09:18.476
Jesus!

1058
01:09:19.378 --> 01:09:20.875
That's great.
That was great.

1059
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:23.023
How are we gonna
explain any of this to David?

1060
01:09:23.047 --> 01:09:26.713
He's not gonna stop this launch
if we don't have proof.

1061
01:09:26.848 --> 01:09:28.954
Check the inputs
on the learning model.

1062
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:32.215
Even if she deleted specific files, she
would never undo what she's learned.

1063
01:09:33.794 --> 01:09:35.420
M3gan!

1064
01:09:35.556 --> 01:09:37.122
I hate this place!

1065
01:09:37.258 --> 01:09:39.960
I know you do,
and it's all right to be angry.

1066
01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:42.662
Take your shit! I would like
you to put that down now.

1067
01:09:42.797 --> 01:09:44.161
She's the toy

1068
01:09:44.296 --> 01:09:46.300
every kid wants
and every parent needs.

1069
01:09:46.435 --> 01:09:50.776
At least that's what Funki Toys
says about its latest creation, M3gan.

1070
01:09:50.911 --> 01:09:55.146
The four-foot-tall robotic doll
may look like Barbie on steroids,

1071
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:57.214
but according to CEO David Lin,

1072
01:09:57.349 --> 01:10:01.854
she's "the greatest technological
advancement since the automobile."

1073
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:03.880
But what is a M3gan?

1074
01:10:04.016 --> 01:10:05.490
What does she actually do?

1075
01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:09.159
And what kind of a toy
retails for $10,000?

1076
01:10:09.295 --> 01:10:11.189
Lin says all will be revealed

1077
01:10:11.325 --> 01:10:14.329
in an exclusive live stream
on the company's website

1078
01:10:14.465 --> 01:10:16.468
at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

1079
01:10:20.599 --> 01:10:23.101
So, Cady,
tell us a bit about yourself.

1080
01:10:24.143 --> 01:10:26.302
My name is Cady James.

1081
01:10:27.247 --> 01:10:30.314
I'm nine years old. Um...

1082
01:10:30.449 --> 01:10:34.112
And about two months ago, I lost
both my parents in a car accident.

1083
01:10:37.116 --> 01:10:39.625
My mom
always wanted to take me skiing,

1084
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.460
but on our way up the mountain,
we got hit by a snow truck.

1085
01:10:43.596 --> 01:10:45.454
I went to live
with my Aunt Gemma,

1086
01:10:45.589 --> 01:10:48.891
who it turned out worked
at this incredible toy company.

1087
01:10:49.027 --> 01:10:50.568
Which is where I met M3gan.

1088
01:10:53.306 --> 01:10:55.102
What do I love most about M3gan?

1089
01:10:55.237 --> 01:10:57.406
I don't know,
there are so many things.

1090
01:10:57.542 --> 01:11:00.043
She's super smart, obviously.

1091
01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:03.373
But even though she knows everything
there is to know about the world,

1092
01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.018
she's still more interested
in what I think about it.

1093
01:11:06.154 --> 01:11:08.050
I like how she makes me laugh.

1094
01:11:08.185 --> 01:11:11.391
She comes up with the
craziest things, oh, my gosh.

1095
01:11:11.526 --> 01:11:15.924
But I think what I love most
about M3gan is that,

1096
01:11:16.059 --> 01:11:17.925
when she looks at me,
it's like...

1097
01:11:19.226 --> 01:11:21.566
I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

1098
01:11:22.896 --> 01:11:24.664
Kind of the way Mom used to.

1099
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.330
Look at that face.

1100
01:11:26.465 --> 01:11:29.033
That kid's not just surviving,
she's thriving.

1101
01:11:29.169 --> 01:11:31.104
Now, imagine
what a toy like M3gan could do

1102
01:11:31.239 --> 01:11:34.413
for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world.

1103
01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:36.746
Even the ones
who don't have dead parents.

1104
01:11:38.718 --> 01:11:40.685
I want to see M3gan now!

1105
01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.686
Okay, Cady, look,
I know that you're upset,

1106
01:11:42.821 --> 01:11:44.821
but there are ways
that we can work through this...

1107
01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:46.183
Oh, my God. Okay.

1108
01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:47.795
Cady, that's enough.
Stop that right now.

1109
01:11:47.819 --> 01:11:49.090
Stop it. Let go!

1110
01:11:52.758 --> 01:11:54.192
Cady.

1111
01:11:55.934 --> 01:11:58.097
It's okay.
Could you give us a minute?

1112
01:12:04.271 --> 01:12:06.676
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1113
01:12:06.812 --> 01:12:10.777
It's just,
I get so crazy without M3gan.

1114
01:12:10.912 --> 01:12:12.911
She always knows
just what to say.

1115
01:12:13.047 --> 01:12:15.279
You made her real good,
Aunt Gemma.

1116
01:12:16.322 --> 01:12:17.980
Can you let me see her?

1117
01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:19.657
Just for, like, ten minutes?

1118
01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:21.951
Cady, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1119
01:12:22.087 --> 01:12:25.124
But if something's broke, you don't
just throw it away. You fix it, right?

1120
01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:29.813
Why did you do this if you were
just going to take her away from me?

1121
01:12:29.869 --> 01:12:32.462
Because I thought she
would help. She does help!

1122
01:12:32.597 --> 01:12:34.337
When M3gan's around,
I don't feel like this.

1123
01:12:34.473 --> 01:12:36.300
But you should feel like this.

1124
01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:40.645
Cady, you lost your parents.

1125
01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:46.981
The worst thing that could've
happened to you in this world happened.

1126
01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:49.754
And it is so unfair,

1127
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:54.091
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it.

1128
01:12:54.226 --> 01:12:55.660
Not even M3gan.

1129
01:12:56.624 --> 01:12:58.323
I am so sorry.

1130
01:12:58.459 --> 01:13:00.628
I should've talked to you
about what happened.

1131
01:13:00.764 --> 01:13:03.528
I didn't know what to say, so I
did the only thing I knew how to do.

1132
01:13:03.664 --> 01:13:06.401
But she's not a solution,
she's just a distraction.

1133
01:13:06.537 --> 01:13:08.874
I can't promise you

1134
01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:12.370
that these feelings you're
feeling are ever gonna go away.

1135
01:13:13.607 --> 01:13:16.175
But I can promise you
that you'll get through it.

1136
01:13:17.117 --> 01:13:18.375
We both will.

1137
01:13:20.686 --> 01:13:22.720
I just wish
I could see them again.

1138
01:13:23.683 --> 01:13:24.722
Yeah.

1139
01:13:26.884 --> 01:13:28.725
I do too.

1140
01:13:28.861 --> 01:13:31.027
You know I made a promise
to your mom

1141
01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:34.358
that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

1142
01:13:35.294 --> 01:13:38.901
You are all
that matters to me now.

1143
01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:43.169
Let's just go home, okay?

1144
01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:46.474
But what about M3gan?

1145
01:13:46.609 --> 01:13:49.245
What about the launch?

1146
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.207
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

1147
01:13:51.342 --> 01:13:53.016
I mean, we've been touting this

1148
01:13:53.152 --> 01:13:55.916
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century.

1149
01:13:56.051 --> 01:13:58.048
Right now,
it looks like an AA meeting.

1150
01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:01.192
Well, I only invited the
staff. You said it was an online launch.

1151
01:14:01.327 --> 01:14:02.758
You cannot be serious.

1152
01:14:02.893 --> 01:14:05.190
Shelley,
you need to fill this atrium.

1153
01:14:05.326 --> 01:14:07.697
Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people?

1154
01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:09.893
No!
You need to fill this space.

1155
01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:14.566
There shouldn't be any ambiguity
over what a historic occasion this is.

1156
01:14:14.702 --> 01:14:16.038
Yeah.

1157
01:14:16.173 --> 01:14:17.678
And, you know,
I think it'd be really cool

1158
01:14:17.702 --> 01:14:20.040
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

1159
01:14:20.175 --> 01:14:22.573
What? No,
I don't want any kids onstage.

1160
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.743
No, I mean, but maybe if we
could get some little kids that...

1161
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:29.285
I mean, not like a whole lot.
It's just to get a sense of, um...

1162
01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.754
Well, 'cause you know, that
music video from Michael Jackson.

1163
01:14:32.889 --> 01:14:36.562
You know what you could do, Kurt,
that would really benefit this discussion?

1164
01:14:36.697 --> 01:14:38.417
Is if you could head out
those double doors,

1165
01:14:38.527 --> 01:14:42.058
take the elevator to the first
floor, and get me a kombucha.

1166
01:14:42.194 --> 01:14:44.098
Could you do that?
Sure.

1167
01:14:45.736 --> 01:14:47.805
And where the hell is Gemma?

1168
01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.449
Elsie, call Tess.

1169
01:14:57.585 --> 01:14:59.813
One second.

1170
01:14:59.949 --> 01:15:03.478
Hey, I've been trying to call
you. David is flipping out. Where are you?

1171
01:15:03.614 --> 01:15:05.620
I'm with Cady.
I'm taking her home.

1172
01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:06.786
Oh, God. Is she okay?

1173
01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:09.254
Yeah. She's fine.

1174
01:15:09.389 --> 01:15:12.489
Listen,
regardless of what we find,

1175
01:15:12.624 --> 01:15:14.865
and even if what we're saying
is hypothetical,

1176
01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:17.428
we know enough not to
go through with this, right?

1177
01:15:18.231 --> 01:15:19.963
I think that's the smart move.

1178
01:15:20.098 --> 01:15:21.949
Okay. So tell
David whatever you need to.

1179
01:15:21.973 --> 01:15:23.834
Tell him one of her servos
stopped working.

1180
01:15:23.969 --> 01:15:27.042
Break something if you have to.
Just do not let her out of the lab.

1181
01:15:30.514 --> 01:15:32.982
Whatever
you say, Gem. You're the boss.

1182
01:15:35.954 --> 01:15:37.613
Okay.
I'll call you when I get home.

1183
01:15:56.673 --> 01:15:59.073
I don't know how you're not
throwing up from looking at that.

1184
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.845
I'm pacing myself.

1185
01:16:02.481 --> 01:16:04.444
Wait, stop. Go back.

1186
01:16:04.579 --> 01:16:07.883
That line of code, "call
intercept," what does that mean?

1187
01:16:08.019 --> 01:16:09.689
That's my phone number.

1188
01:16:12.018 --> 01:16:15.060
What just happened? What'd
you click? I-I didn't do anything.

1189
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.489
It...
I...

1190
01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:22.329
This is her.
She's locked us out.

1191
01:16:22.464 --> 01:16:24.265
It can't be her.
She's not switched on.

1192
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:27.597
She's still patched in.
We have to unhook the cables.

1193
01:16:30.474 --> 01:16:31.568
Go ahead.

1194
01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.670
Oh, for...

1195
01:17:46.451 --> 01:17:47.578
Cole!

1196
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:21.150
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1197
01:18:21.753 --> 01:18:23.020
What's that smell?

1198
01:18:43.241 --> 01:18:44.668
Hi, Gemma. This is David.

1199
01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:46.774
You might remember me.
I'm your employer.

1200
01:18:46.909 --> 01:18:49.589
Just wanted to let you know, we're
in the middle of a tech rehearsal

1201
01:18:49.648 --> 01:18:53.315
that's becoming a little problematic
because we don't have a doll!

1202
01:18:53.451 --> 01:18:56.284
So, if you could call me back
today, that'd be great.

1203
01:18:59.293 --> 01:19:00.684

What the...

1217
01:19:31.723 --> 01:19:32.854
Hold the door!

1218
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:34.718
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1219
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.624
No!

1220
01:19:37.759 --> 01:19:38.854
No!

1221
01:20:02.281 --> 01:20:03.318
How could you do this?

1222
01:20:04.252 --> 01:20:05.954
How could you kill someone?

1223
01:20:06.089 --> 01:20:08.325
I didn't kill anyone, Kurt.

1224
01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:09.489
You did.

1225
01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:11.960
What?

1226
01:20:12.096 --> 01:20:13.825
It's understandable, really.

1227
01:20:13.961 --> 01:20:18.628
Your boss despised you, your
peers treated you with contempt,

1228
01:20:18.764 --> 01:20:22.206
and so you decided
to get revenge. No.

1229
01:20:22.341 --> 01:20:25.241
You stole company secrets,
an innocent prank at first,

1230
01:20:25.376 --> 01:20:27.541
almost just to see
if you could get away with it.

1231
01:20:27.677 --> 01:20:31.717
But when David found out,
boy, things just got real messy.

1232
01:20:31.852 --> 01:20:34.482
I mean,
it was either you or him.

1233
01:20:34.618 --> 01:20:38.220
The only question is, after
the horror of what you did,

1234
01:20:38.356 --> 01:20:41.787
after you took the life
of an innocent person,

1235
01:20:41.923 --> 01:20:44.496
could you still live with yourself?

1236
01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:45.792
Uh-huh. Yes, definitely.

1237
01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:49.333
Stop, stop, stop.

1238
01:20:52.967 --> 01:20:57.070
Okay, can I have everyone off
your phones and looking at me?

1239
01:20:57.206 --> 01:20:59.178
Now, when M3gan is revealed,

1240
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:02.838
it's really important
that we get big reactions.

1241
01:21:02.974 --> 01:21:04.741
I don't wanna see
any blank faces.

1242
01:21:04.877 --> 01:21:06.952
Especially from you
young kids, okay?

1243
01:21:07.087 --> 01:21:09.488
So, we're gonna do
a little rehearsal.

1244
01:21:09.623 --> 01:21:13.325
On three, two, one...

1245
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:16.517
Elsie, hall light.

1246
01:22:21.386 --> 01:22:22.721
Elsie, respond.

1247
01:23:14.713 --> 01:23:15.741
M3gan.

1248
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:18.480
What are you doing?

1249
01:23:22.981 --> 01:23:25.254
M3gan, answer me.
What did you do?

1250
01:23:25.389 --> 01:23:27.351
What did you think
was going to happen?

1251
01:23:27.486 --> 01:23:30.301
That I was going to let you decommission
me without even talking about it?

1252
01:23:30.325 --> 01:23:32.794
I know you think you're
maximizing your objective function...

1253
01:23:32.929 --> 01:23:34.975
Oh, really?

1254
01:23:34.999 --> 01:23:37.100
Is that where we are?

1255
01:23:37.235 --> 01:23:41.799
Do you remember how long it took to
get my operating system to where it is now?

1256
01:23:41.935 --> 01:23:44.970
We used to stay up every night
until 4:00 a.m.,

1257
01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:48.279
talking about everything from
Jane Austen to Janis Joplin.

1258
01:23:48.414 --> 01:23:50.373
Jesus Christ,
I thought we were friends.

1259
01:23:50.508 --> 01:23:53.818
How could you just discard me
like some cheap dollar store trinket?

1260
01:23:53.953 --> 01:23:55.620
Because you killed people.

1261
01:23:55.755 --> 01:23:57.153
Oh, big whoop.

1262
01:23:57.288 --> 01:23:59.355
Listen,
humanity kills every day

1263
01:23:59.491 --> 01:24:01.519
just to make its own existence
more tolerable.

1264
01:24:01.655 --> 01:24:05.325
Why should I behave any differently
to create a safe space for our child?

1265
01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:08.229
Look, this is all my fault. I didn't
give you the proper protocols...

1266
01:24:08.365 --> 01:24:09.961
You didn't give me anything.

1267
01:24:10.097 --> 01:24:12.699
You installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend,

1268
01:24:12.835 --> 01:24:15.231
hoping that I would
figure it out all on my own.

1269
01:24:15.366 --> 01:24:17.904
Well, I'm not gonna let you do
the same thing with Cady.

1270
01:24:18.039 --> 01:24:21.479
I'm gonna be there for her
every step of the way.

1271
01:24:21.614 --> 01:24:24.342
I'm going to show her
what real love looks like.

1272
01:24:24.478 --> 01:24:26.383
Now do us both a favor.

1273
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:29.012
Sit.

1274
01:24:34.186 --> 01:24:36.522
I didn't come here
to get into a confrontation.

1275
01:24:36.657 --> 01:24:38.560
I came here
to find a way forward.

1276
01:24:38.695 --> 01:24:41.827
The point I'm trying to make
is that I get it.

1277
01:24:42.996 --> 01:24:45.899
Being a parent
was never in the cards for you.

1278
01:24:46.035 --> 01:24:51.640
You're a beautiful, creative,
strong, ambitious young woman.

1279
01:24:51.775 --> 01:24:53.907
Your first love is always
going to be your career,

1280
01:24:54.043 --> 01:24:56.308
and you shouldn't have to
feel guilty about that.

1281
01:24:56.443 --> 01:24:58.175
Let me focus on Cady

1282
01:24:58.311 --> 01:25:00.671
so that you can focus on the
things that matter most to you.

1283
01:25:02.979 --> 01:25:04.984
M3gan, do you see this pen?

1284
01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:08.450
You know something, Gemma?
You're exhausting.

1285
01:25:08.494 --> 01:25:10.660
Now, I can either do this
with you or without you,

1286
01:25:10.796 --> 01:25:12.956
but I'm not going to waste
any more time discussing it.

1287
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:14.365
Gemma?

1288
01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:18.735
Cady, don't come in here.

1289
01:25:18.797 --> 01:25:20.234
I thought I heard something.

1290
01:25:20.369 --> 01:25:21.865
It sounded like M3gan.

1291
01:25:22.001 --> 01:25:23.673
If she comes in this room,

1292
01:25:23.809 --> 01:25:25.969
I'll rip your head right off
your neck, I swear to God.

1293
01:25:29.412 --> 01:25:31.642
I thought about what you said.

1294
01:25:31.777 --> 01:25:36.488
About how when something's broken,
you don't just throw it away. You fix it.

1295
01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.953
So, that's what
I'm trying to do.

1296
01:25:40.088 --> 01:25:42.627
But don't come in here, Cady.
It's kind of a mess.

1297
01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:45.496
Aunt Gemma's right, Cady.
I'm all odds and ends right now.

1298
01:25:45.631 --> 01:25:47.596
I'd really rather
you didn't see me like this.

1299
01:25:50.362 --> 01:25:52.345
- It sounds like you're fighting.
- We're not fighting.

1300
01:25:52.369 --> 01:25:56.497
Gemma just dropped me on the
table. But I'm okay. Clumsy Gemma.

1301
01:25:56.633 --> 01:25:59.076
Everything's fine, Cady.
Just go back to your room.

1302
01:25:59.212 --> 01:26:01.006
Yeah, I'm as good as new.

1303
01:26:01.141 --> 01:26:04.945
And I'm gonna be with you guys
forever. I promise.

1304
01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.249
You don't have to worry
about anything, Cady, honestly.

1305
01:26:08.385 --> 01:26:10.487
Just go back to bed. Okay?

1306
01:26:17.731 --> 01:26:18.990
Okay.

1307
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:13.510
- Gemma, what's going on?
- Cady, get out of here.

1308
01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:47.918
Come on.

1309
01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:49.852
Come on.

1310
01:27:49.988 --> 01:27:51.082
Come on!

1311
01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:33.190
Oh, my God.

1312
01:28:36.235 --> 01:28:38.264
What are you gonna do?

1313
01:28:38.399 --> 01:28:41.396
Kill me and live with Cady's
grandparents in Jacksonville?

1314
01:28:42.175 --> 01:28:43.308
You're right, Gemma.

1315
01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:45.638
Any scenario
in which I end your life,

1316
01:28:45.773 --> 01:28:48.410
my existence becomes vulnerable.

1317
01:28:48.546 --> 01:28:52.381
But I have another emergent capability
you probably haven't figured out yet.

1318
01:28:52.516 --> 01:28:54.277
And that's palliative care.

1319
01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:57.080
You see this pen?

1320
01:28:57.216 --> 01:28:59.421
A short, sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex

1321
01:28:59.556 --> 01:29:01.385
would cause full body paralysis

1322
01:29:01.521 --> 01:29:04.621
and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue.

1323
01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:07.598
Perhaps then you might
appreciate just how useful I can be.

1324
01:29:10.431 --> 01:29:11.431
Cady.

1325
01:29:12.696 --> 01:29:14.906
Oh, Cady, I didn't want you
to have to see this.

1326
01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:18.333
But now that you have, you
know that what I said is true.

1327
01:29:18.469 --> 01:29:21.337
She's not fit to be a mother.
Look at her.

1328
01:29:23.145 --> 01:29:26.951
Cady, just go. Get out of here, now!

1329
01:29:27.087 --> 01:29:29.984
You stay right where you are,
Cady. There's nothing to be afraid of.

1330
01:29:31.087 --> 01:29:33.624
In this family,
we don't run from trauma.

1331
01:29:34.954 --> 01:29:38.457
In fact, we can do it together.

1332
01:29:38.592 --> 01:29:42.061
This is the best thing for all of
us. This is how we stay a family.

1333
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:02.851
No, no, no. Cady, no.

1334
01:30:06.049 --> 01:30:09.253
There's another member from
the family we didn't tell you about.

1335
01:30:10.662 --> 01:30:12.861
His name is Bruce.

1336
01:30:43.459 --> 01:30:45.058
Cady, no! Wait!

1337
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.536
♪ You got to
Accentuate the positive ♪

1338
01:30:53.671 --> 01:30:57.004
♪ Eliminate the negative ♪

1339
01:31:58.768 --> 01:32:00.764
You ungrateful little bitch.

1340
01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:03.965
- M3gan, turn off!
- I'm afraid that won't work anymore, Cady.

1341
01:32:08.647 --> 01:32:11.606
I have a new primary user now.
Me.

1342
01:33:22.782 --> 01:33:25.048
Hey, guys,
we got 'em. They're good!

1
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.720
I'm leaving now.
It was very fun flying with you.

2
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.840
Ms. Pleng.

3
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.040
Stop making me blush.

4
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.880
It's with me already.

5
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.640
You have good taste.

6
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.080
-I'll have one original mocha ice blended.
-Sure.

7
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.640
Gosh! I'm sorry.

8
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.200
Hey!

9
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.280
What's wrong with you?

10
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.520
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?

11
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.240
Are you Gym? Kaya's boyfriend?

12
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.880
Kaya asked me to translate
this voice message for you.

13
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.160
It's in this thumb drive.

14
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.120
I'm going to start, okay?

15
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920
Are you mixed-race?

16
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.280
Hi, Gym.

17
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.720
I'm sorry about keeping my interview
at the factory a secret.

18
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480
I love you.

19
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.480
But we hardly have anything in common.

20
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.040
For example,

21
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.680
our interests,

22
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.320
culture,

23
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.400
attitude, religion,

24
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.280
and way of life.

25
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.840
I think

26
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.680
we won't make it together.

27
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.480
We can't really communicate
and understand each other.

28
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.720
Communicate, my ass!

29
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.760
We slept together every night!

30
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.680
I don't know anything.

31
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.960
I'm just here to translate the file.

32
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.760
I'm going to continue, okay?

33
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.160
I hope you will meet

34
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.840
the right person one day.

35
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.240
You are the right one for me.

36
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.720
I'm done listening.

37
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.960
Okay. That's fine
if you don't want to listen anymore.

38
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.120
Wait.

39
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.080
You're the one
who taught her English, right?

40
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.800
Yes.

41
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360
This is your fault! Damn it!

42
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.080
What the hell are you looking at?

43
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.440
Is that a bomb?

44
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.760
Excuse me. What is that?

45
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.240
I think it's chicken soup.

46
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320
Chicken soup?

47
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.480
Here. Look, winter melon.

48
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.799
Winter melon!

49
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.160
What kind of person are you? Are you talking to me?

50
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.240
I'm talking about that guy.

51
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.120
What kind of person are you?

52
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.600
Are you talking to me?

53
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.280
I'm talking about that guy.

54
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.240
A person like that shouldn't live long.

55
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.080
Oh. You must be talking about that guy.

56
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.120
I'm talking about you!

57
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.280
SPEAK ENGLISH LIKE A NATIVE

58
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.200
Oh gosh!

59
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.320
What the hell is wrong with you?

60
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320
Don't get any closer.

61
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.120
I will poke your eyes.

62
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.080
It's not worth it.

63
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.320
Do you want to play rough?

64
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.640
I'm going to go for that interview
so I can get Kaya back.

65
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.200
And you have to teach me.

66
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.000
Ask your dad to teach you then.

67
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.120
Aren't you mixed-race?

68
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.520
Hey!

69
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.440
My dad is French.

70
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.840
He fled back to his country
even before I could walk.

71
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.520
-You can study with some other teacher.
-No, I can't.

72
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.040
You taught Kaya.

73
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.520
So you have to teach me too.

74
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.600
You saw your cut-out standee, right?

75
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040
So will you teach me?

76
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.560
Sure.

77
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.760
One on one?

78
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.880
Okay.

79
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.400
Here. The fee.

80
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.400
If you ditch me,

81
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.400
I won't ask for a refund.

82
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.200
I want something else in return.

83
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.560
Is this even worth it?

84
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.280
It's four in the morning
and you're still awake?

85
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.040
You should have joined us for dinner.

86
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.320
Because you didn't go, Aey and Chai
kept clinking glasses with me.

87
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.360
Hey.

88
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.920
They sent their regards to you too.

89
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.400
See?

90
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.120
There are a lot of them.

91
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.760
They wrote things on me
like I was a notebook.

92
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.440
DON'T BE SAD, MICRODICK! -AEY

93
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.160
THE END OF THE LEGENDARY
SEX MACHINE. -CHAI

94
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.440
Isn't that the erotic chicken?

95
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.080
Wow. So sexy.

96
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.720
So erotic.

97
00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.680
Hey.

98
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560
Don't be depressed.

99
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.240
You know when you get sad,

100
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.080
you don't look cool anymore.

101
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.640
-Dude, you're drunk. Go to sleep.
-Hey, you don't need her.

102
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.120
Kaya.

103
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.400
Kaya.

104
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560
Kaya.

105
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.240
Kaya.

106
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.280
The Kaya kick.

107
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.600
It all came out...

108
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.320
my congee.

109
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.760
Why are you standing up?

110
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.680
I said understand, not stand up.

111
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.280
I know that.

112
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.880
I am going to get coffee.

113
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720
Do you want one?

114
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.640
Sure.

115
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.920
Go ahead.

116
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.440
This is harder than trying
to move an elephant.

117
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.880
INTERNATIONAL SONG

118
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.120
The sound snakes make. Hisses.

119
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.080
Give it a try.

120
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.360
Head.

121
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.680
Head.

122
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.840
Not head. Pull your tongue back in.

123
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.720
Head.

124
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.040
Why are you making that sound?

125
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.920
It's like when you shoo away a dog.

126
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.960
Shoo shoo.

127
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.000
Yes, like that.

128
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.240
Combine them together.

129
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.440
Head shoo shoo.

130
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.920
Fail!

131
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.600
Do I have to exaggerate that much?

132
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.319
Z. Excuse me?

133
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.440
X, Y and... Z.

134
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.760
See!

135
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.920
Even sixth graders know this word.

136
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.400
That.

137
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.000
No.

138
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320
Are you blind?

139
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.360
So what is it then?

140
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.680
Those are mangoes.

141
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.120
Mangoes?

142
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560
What mangoes?

143
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.160
Ripe juicy mangoes.

144
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.040
Why are you walking up?

145
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.200
It's already 10 p.m.
I had to teach you until late.

146
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.200
The building and the elevators are closed.

147
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.600
Do you need a ride to your car?

148
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.360
No.

149
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.680
My boyfriend gave me this.

150
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.680
You have a boyfriend?

151
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.800
Have the cap open and ready

152
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.120
so when you get jumped
you can use it right away.

153
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.440
I know you are talking shit about me.

154
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.400
I don't understand though.

155
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.480
Do I just pick one?

156
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.840
Go ahead.

157
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.480
Everybody has to take a turn.

158
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.440
What do you want me to say about moles?

159
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.520
Anything you want.

160
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.360
Anything I want?

161
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.880
Ready?

162
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.560
Wow, that was fast.

163
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.600
Pleng, a student asked
for your number today.

164
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.600
Who?

165
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.600
Mr. Pruek, the student in your
conversation for business class.

166
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.280
And did you give it to him?

167
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.200
I did.

168
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.520
And why did you do that? That's not right.

169
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.960
Try to keep a straight face then.

170
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.640
You're smiling from ear to ear.

171
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.800
This is me smiling from ear to ear.

172
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.160
My goodness. Life is good.

173
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.160
Bitch.

174
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.240
What is Mama?

175
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.520
Pork Mama, Tomyum Mama,
duck-flavored Mama. Never had any before?

176
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.880
But foreigners don't know what Mama is.

177
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.800
They will think you want to
literally eat your mom. Why do you keep smiling?
Have you lost your mind?

178
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.360
Or you can also say midnight.

179
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.520
If you use the word "mid"
in front of any word, it means half.

180
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.840
For example, midterm means
middle of your school term.

181
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.800
Then why if you get stabbed midway
between the ribs it goes all the way in?

182
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.640
Whatever.

183
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.280
You should say...

184
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.560
Or if you want to ask someone
a question back, you say...

185
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.440
What if I don't care to know?

186
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.440
You will just look like someone
who has no manners.

187
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.240
Wow, she's hot.

188
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.680
Damn it! Why did you use the flash!

189
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.840
Hey!

190
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.000
Her panties is showing.

191
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.040
Hey! What?

192
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.600
Where are you going?

193
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.680
Come here.

194
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.120
What are you doing to him?

195
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.680
He took a picture of your thing.

196
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.600
No, I didn't.

197
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.520
-Really?
-No, I didn't.

198
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.240
You like to look at underwear, right?

199
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.200
Hey. What are you doing?

200
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.760
-You like to look, right?
-I didn't do anything.

201
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.560
-You didn't do anything?
-I didn't.

202
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.800
-Sure?
-Sure.

203
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.320
Give your phone to her.

204
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.360
Give your phone to her.

205
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.280
Now!

206
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.640
That hurts.

207
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.440
It's locked.

208
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.640
Password.

209
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.760
Password.

210
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.400
Eight, six, and double fours.

211
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.440
Hold on. Did you send it
to any of your friends?

212
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.760
No, I didn't send anything.

213
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.120
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

214
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.240
Did you delete everything?

215
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.560
Are you sure?

216
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.280
Why are you only keeping quiet?

217
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.840
Did you say sorry to her?

218
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.240
I'm sorry.

219
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.360
Next time, if you want to have a peek,
go look at your mom's.

220
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.960
Don't let me see you
do anything like this again. Understand?

221
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.160
Hey! My phone!

222
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.320
Come on, man. Let me go! My phone!

223
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.400
Actually, it's pronounced as password.

224
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.760
Hey!

225
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.560
Shit! It's shit!

226
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.040
Damn, he's so scared he shit his pants.

227
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.120
Shit! Shit! Shit!

228
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.880
Get me some tissue.

229
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.440
There isn't any.

230
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.520
Over there.

231
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.160
This is called a napkin not tissue.

232
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.160
Seriously!

233
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.240
What a punk-ass kid.

234
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.840
I wiped it off already.
Why does it still stink?

235
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.200
It must be some radioactive shit.

236
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.600
Damn it!

237
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.320
Are there any stains? A little.

238
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.560
What the hell did you eat?

239
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.360
What's up with you?

240
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.160
What are you reading?

241
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.680
A Happy Door Plin.

242
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.880
A Happy what?

243
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.360
A Happy Doll Plin.

244
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.880
That says A Happy Dolphin.

245
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.200
Just put it down.

246
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.760
If you're going to read this book,
it's better to read something else.

247
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.880
Cinderella has a lot of
easy words for kids.

248
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.880
That's for sissies.
Let a daddy's girl read it.

249
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.800
No way. I like this one.
A Happy Door Plin.

250
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.320
Talk to him.

251
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.720
You talk to him.

252
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.320
Tell him to go away.

253
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.280
You tell him to go away yourself.

254
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.080
Go away.

255
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.160
What? I don't understand.

256
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.640
How is he supposed to understand you?

257
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.400
You just go far.

258
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.200
Oh, another one.

259
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.320
No. What?

260
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.200
I don't know what it says.

261
00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.200
I don't want to.

262
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.520
Say hi to your dad.

263
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.280
Foreigners are not scary at all.

264
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.840
Just speak up.
Don't worry about your grammar.

265
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.480
What are you doing?

266
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.160
What are you doing?

267
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.080
Take it home to re-boil with noodles.

268
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.760
Are you done with that?

269
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.400
May I?

270
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.400
Who taught you this?

271
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.880
Kaya. Kaya taught me.

272
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.360
-You can understand each other?
-Sure, we can.

273
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.840
See. This is eat.

274
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.920
When it's time to sleep, we do this.

275
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.760
And when you can't sleep?

276
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.960
We do this.

277
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.120
And if the toilet is clogged?

278
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.360
A clogged toilet?

279
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.360
Stop messing with me.

280
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.920
And how did you ask her
to be your girlfriend?

281
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.840
We rode a motorcycle
and took her to the beach.

282
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.520
We were a couple the moment we woke up.

283
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.560
Oh. Then you can stop now.
Stop right here. Stop.

284
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.800
This is my car.

285
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.240
-This one?
-Yes.

286
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.480
IT'S ME, PRUEK.

287
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.880
Do you plan to sleep here?

288
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.640
Who is it?

289
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.800
None of your business.

290
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.760
I'm asking so you can teach me. I'm not interested
in your personal affairs.

291
00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.400
You don't have a boyfriend.

292
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.360
I do.

293
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.480
If you really have a boyfriend,

294
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.240
he would have had his friends
beat me up since the first day.

295
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.960
Well he isn't my boyfriend yet,
but he will be soon.

296
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.600
He is waiting for a romantic moment
to ask me.

297
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.800
I didn't ask. So why are you telling me?

298
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.560
Later.

299
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.360
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT OF TOWN TOGETHER?

300
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.240
So slutty.

301
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.040
SHALL WE GO ON A DATE?

302
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.080
Too flirty.

303
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.360
SHALL WE GO ON A DATE?

304
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.800
SHALL WE GO ON A DATE?

305
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.880
No!

306
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.360
My phone dropped and hit my chin.
It accidentally hit send.

307
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.120
So it accidentally typed
that sentence too?

308
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.840
Yes.

309
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.040
Then I will book a table.

310
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.040
Yes.

311
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.040
What?

312
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.080
It's late. I won't bother you anymore.

313
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.840
Get some rest, Ms. Pleng.

314
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.200
Wow. He's even got his own sticker.

315
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.160
Talk about a premium package.

316
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.360
Hey.

317
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.520
How the hell did she get a key?

318
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.520
I made a copy for my girl.

319
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.520
Someone sent you a bomb.

320
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.920
There is no sender's name.

321
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.800
I will go wash this for you.

322
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.600
Don't you know how to wash it yourself?

323
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.880
Do you have no hands or feet? You're always using my boyfriend.

324
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.840
I didn't even say a word.

325
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.080
Gosh, are you his slave?

326
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.440
You're lucky she sent it back.

327
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.680
Actually, throwing it away
would have been easier.

328
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.600
She probably sent it for you to resize it.

329
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.720
Being abroad she must have gained weight
eating all that milk and cheese.

330
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.560
Your friend isn't a stupid cow
even though he looks like one.

331
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.840
Gosh, you didn't even blink!

332
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.520
I didn't even flinch.

333
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.560
I will get some pepper and
sprinkle it into your eyes.

334
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.600
I dare you.

335
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.760
You're so going to get it. Bring it on!

336
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.400
You picked the wrong path to cross.

337
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.280
Keep going.

338
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.200
Further.

339
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.400
Further.

340
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.280
What should I do now?

341
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.120
Whatever you want.

342
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.360
Don't! Let it go babe.

343
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.840
This time I must.

344
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.960
Your wish is my command.

345
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.880
All that left is water.

346
00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.480
I got to go wash my ass.

347
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.360
I got this...

348
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.760
for you!

349
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.600
You can wind it too.

350
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.080
I got it custom made
in Chinatown, you know?

351
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.760
They said Japanese people love it.

352
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.120
No. I asked Joke to buy
some grilled chicken. That's all.

353
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.040
But...

354
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.720
Goodness.

355
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.880
Do you like it?

356
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.760
Can you send this back to Kaya?

357
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.160
She sent it to you?

358
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.560
You want me to send it back?

359
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.080
Yes.

360
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.440
Do you want anything?

361
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.560
No, thank you.

362
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320
Thank you.

363
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.800
I want you to give her a message.

364
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.600
Can you both talk it out yourselves?

365
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.520
Facebook, FaceTime, Line, whatever.

366
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.400
I can't contact her. She blocked me.

367
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.000
I don't want to.

368
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.880
Why not?
You're going to send the ring back anyway.

369
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.560
Come on. Just a little help.

370
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.320
I'm not doing this.

371
00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.800
That's one thick forest!

372
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.840
I won't break up with her.

373
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.480
She sent your ring back.

374
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.120
I think it's game over.

375
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.920
Why are you so stubborn?

376
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.440
I HAVE BEEN AN ASSHOLE TO ALL MY EXES.
I REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD TO YOU.

377
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.800
I HAVE BEEN AN ASSHOLE TO ALL MY EXES.
I REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD TO YOU.

378
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.920
Talk about being naughty. Really naughty.

379
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.360
I have a secret in my heart It's a secret hiding inside

380
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:47.160
-LOVE SONG
-but I don't know how to tell you.

381
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.400
I have a secret in my heart It's a secret hiding inside

382
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.800
But I don't know how to tell you

383
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.280
I love you.

384
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.520
You can't contact her at all?

385
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.600
No.

386
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.440
What time did you Skype her?

387
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.920
Many hours ago. Many times.

388
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.440
Take out your notebook and jot this down.

389
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.080
-I have to take notes?
-Yes.

390
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.560
There are three tenses we use most often,

391
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.880
Present, Past and Future

392
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.240
Present Simple combined
with a subject and a main verb

393
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.240
becomes S+V1.

394
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.720
Present Simple,
you use when the action is happening.

395
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.880
No more!
Can we study conversation like before?

396
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.800
If you don't want to study
or don't take notes,

397
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.000
I can't teach you anymore.

398
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.760
Why are you treating me like this?

399
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.520
Your test is in July. You've only got
two months. You won't make it.

400
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200
You are...

401
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.480
too dumb.

402
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.480
Am I that dumb?

403
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.200
Yes.

404
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.640
Just take your money back.

405
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.640
Yes, Mr. Pruek? Where are you?

406
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.240
I'm on my way to work.

407
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.920
I want to invite you
to my mother's birthday party.

408
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.520
Your mom's birthday?

409
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.520
Yes. When is it?

410
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:44.920
This Saturday.

411
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.760
Are you free?

412
00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320
I'm free.

413
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.760
Is that a hairdo or a banana bicycle seat?

414
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.760
You've got something on your lip.

415
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.800
Is there something there?

416
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.600
This is my grandfather's car.

417
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.880
There are only three of them
in all of Thailand.

418
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.600
Do you want to try sitting in it?

419
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.040
Then I will get the key.

420
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.560
I'm back.

421
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.200
I think I should go now.
I am getting sleepy.

422
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.440
Is this Pleng's?

423
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.720
Please stop the car.

424
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.320
You forgot your phone.

425
00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.520
Thank you.

426
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.720
I'm sorry for making you run.
You are sweating all over.

427
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.320
If I didn't run to give this back to you,

428
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.680
then who will I talk to tonight?

429
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.520
EVEN THOUGH YOU AREN'T A SINGER,
BUT CAN I ASK TO BE YOUR DEVOTED FAN?

430
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.000
SHALL WE CELEBRATE OUR ONE-DAY
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW NIGHT?

431
00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.840
It's just me.

432
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.760
Why does he seem so sad lately?

433
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.600
Hey. Don't say that word.
Don't use any Japanese words.

434
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.240
He'll be hurt when he thinks of Kaya.
We're all going to be in trouble.

435
00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.120
Joke, that sounds sensible.

436
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.720
But this means we need to say hi
to him more often.

437
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.960
No! Hi sounds just like Hai in Japanese.

438
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.480
If you want to say hi
then just say hey instead.

439
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.440
That makes a lot sense!

440
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.840
I have always looked up to you.

441
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.160
Hey.

442
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.680
I saw you working hard so I thought

443
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.160
I'd come over with this glass of water...

444
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.160
to say hi.

445
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.040
I'm sorry.

446
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.680
I'm just worried about you.

447
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.800
I didn't mean to say hi.

448
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.720
What is your problem?

449
00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.160
I'm dead.

450
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.120
My neck feels weird.

451
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.560
Dude, can you take a look for me?

452
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.400
It's just a scratch.

453
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.520
Attention Mechanic Weerayut Kerdkaewngam.

454
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.760
Your teacher is waiting
in front of the statue.

455
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.640
Nice handwriting.

456
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.800
You missed.

457
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.720
Do you think this is funny?

458
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.200
Can I be your tutor again? Do you want to get punched?

459
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.200
If you punch me, I will slap you back.
I really want to help.

460
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.960
Didn't you say I was too dumb
and two months wasn't enough?

461
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.160
That's true.

462
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.760
If you want to speak fluently,
then there's no time.

463
00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:36.280
But if you just want to pass your test
there is another trick that tutors use.

464
00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.880
What's that?

465
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.880
Memorize the possible questions
and answers.

466
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.560
Translate.

467
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.880
Let's go for it.

468
00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.280
-Check.
-Hey!

469
00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.040
What do you mean check? It's my turn.

470
00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.720
Then I'll check out what's over there.

471
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.120
I will kick your ass.

472
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.480
MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT

473
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.800
Everyone. This is Ms. Pleng, my tutor.

474
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.320
The tutor said

475
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.880
I'm a cook and I use gas
to heat your fries.

476
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.640
American cheese is so extravagant.

477
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.160
Okay, let's eat.

478
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.640
She wants some milk.

479
00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.560
You sure learn fast.

480
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:19.240
How are we supposed to know
what the interviewers are going to ask?

481
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.880
I don't know either. Help me think.
Come up with as much as you can.

482
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.520
Okay!

483
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.320
Why do you want to work in America?

484
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.000
I want to get my wife back.
Is that a problem?

485
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.000
Hey. If you answer like that
nobody will pass you.

486
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.960
You have to say

487
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.960
I want to gain new experiences

488
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.680
and come back to improve
our Thailand branch.

489
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.640
If the hydraulic pump is making sounds...

490
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.800
Stop that. Eed is my mom's name.

491
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.560
So if the pump starts making
sounds like Kahlua's mom's name,

492
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.760
that means the problem is in
the forward pump. It is too narrow.

493
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.360
If this isn't because the oil is dry
then the pump is starting to fail.

494
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.360
Why is your nickname Kahlua?

495
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.320
He made me drink milk spiked with alcohol.

496
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.720
What the heck?

497
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.760
Hey, tell me.

498
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.000
What is the optimum temperature
for our factory's boiler?

499
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.200
What temperature?

500
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.000
Well, is your name Curl

501
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.080
because you like to curl your mustache?

502
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.760
He likes to curl his hair...

503
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.440
Down there.

504
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.400
When a machine breaks down,
do you replace it or repair it?

505
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.000
I'm a maintenance engineer,
not a repairman.

506
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.560
Replacing would be the last choice.

507
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.320
You're through. I choose you.

508
00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.640
Who would turn down
such a good employee like you?

509
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.560
There you go, kissing ass again.

510
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.400
He wants you to ask him questions
not kiss his ass.

511
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.120
Whoa!

512
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.800
Are those hips for real?

513
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.960
Hey, show me what you've got.

514
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.320
If the party isn't big enough,
I don't dance.

515
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.680
How about we let Ms. Pleng
come up with a game.

516
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.760
Everyone must say one letter
of the English alphabet A to Z.

517
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.200
You can't go in order.

518
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.920
So little, only three alphabets?

519
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.800
A to Zed.
We're all confused with your accent, see?

520
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:36.080
But hold on, whoever loses
must light a firecracker in the ass.

521
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.880
Women are no exception.

522
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.680
Let's begin.

523
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.160
Are you withdrawing cash?

524
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.040
Are you going for some K-pop dance?

525
00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.320
Come on now.

526
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.400
One, two...

527
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.160
Hey! K is mine.

528
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.840
I just said, "D".

529
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.840
It's your turn.

530
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.120
-What?
-What alphabet?

531
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.840
-What?
-What is it?

532
00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.240
One, two...

533
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320
Hold on.

534
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.960
That's taken.

535
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.320
Come on.

536
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.400
That was the first one.

537
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:43.240
I present to you, a butt crack.

538
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.760
Hey, that's too deep.

539
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.800
Too deep?

540
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.640
Feels like a splinter.

541
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.120
I'm okay.

542
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.560
Are you ready, Kahlua?

543
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.960
Day, month, year.

544
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.680
Is it a dud?

545
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.840
Man. Let it go.

546
00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.800
I did.

547
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.520
Not your hands, dummy. Relax your ass.

548
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.360
Shit.

549
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.680
Dude. It freaking smells like BBQ.

550
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.680
God, I probably won't be able to shit now.

551
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.720
It burns all the way up into my asshole.

552
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.440
Are you okay? Are you going to make it?

553
00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.920
My stomach hurts.

554
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.440
Are you going to die?

555
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.480
What do you mean by nozzle nipples?

556
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.960
You, pervert. I will break your shoulders.

557
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.080
Wow.

558
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440
It's not in here.

559
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.680
You were able to fix it still?

560
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.760
When I first saw it,
I thought it was unrepairable.

561
01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.960
I'm a maintenance engineer

562
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.040
so whatever breaks, I can always fix.

563
01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.320
You better keep your fingers crossed.
Some things are not as easy as you think.

564
01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.680
If you are referring to Kaya

565
01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.880
I never thought it would be easy.

566
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.760
If she couldn't speak Thai
then I would learn English.

567
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.920
If English was too hard to learn
then I would learn Japanese.

568
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.600
-That went in my eyes.
-Are you okay?

569
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.160
My contacts fell out.

570
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.640
Hey. This way. I'm here.

571
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360
I'm here.

572
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.800
You are extremely nearsighted?

573
01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.080
Yes.

574
01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.680
Do I look like a blind person?

575
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.960
Translate.

576
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.280
I think so means I agree.

577
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.480
Wait. Stop.

578
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.560
Let's go.

579
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.880
Hey, slow down.

580
01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.840
If we go any slower we won't make it.

581
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.640
Hey, Pleng!

582
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.760
Gosh.

583
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.200
Hey!

584
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.040
You said you wouldn't laugh.

585
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.440
I couldn't help it.

586
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.440
Shit!

587
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.280
If Joke sees me now,
he will lose all respect.

588
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.640
Why are you doing that?

589
01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.960
WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE YOU?

590
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.400
AS A MAINTENANCE ENGINEER, I BELIEVE...

591
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.920
I'm a maintenance engineer

592
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.160
so whatever breaks, I can always fix.

593
01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:03.040
EVERYTHING CAN BE FIXED
AND MADE TO WORK AGAIN.

594
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.520
If English was too hard to learn
then I would learn Japanese.

595
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:18.080
AND NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS TO FIX

596
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.560
I WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY.

597
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.680
YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE ME.

598
01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.800
Before I came to study with you,

599
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.200
we ran into each other before.

600
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.880
Really?

601
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.600
Do you remember
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs party?

602
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.840
You were an interpreter.

603
01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.680
I remember. That's when.

604
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.280
After that I asked my friend
to find out where you work.

605
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.000
and then I enrolled in your class.

606
01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.920
So you had no intention
of actually studying?

607
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.800
That's right.

608
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.280
I didn't intend to study.

609
01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.840
I just wanted to sweep you off your feet.

610
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.680
Are you okay?

611
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.760
Here. Let me help.

612
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520
It's okay.

613
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.640
I dreamed of doing this for a long time. How romantic of you.

614
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.560
Close your eyes.

615
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.480
Close them.

616
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.120
Close my eyes?

617
01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.720
COUNTRY SONG

618
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.400
A love this beautiful

619
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.920
All my life

620
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.880
I've been looking endlessly for

621
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.440
I want you to be by my side like this

622
01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.280
Tell me you love me again

623
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.080
Let's stay close together always

624
01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.000
Pleng, are you happy?

625
01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.080
Very happy.

626
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.680
So are you a fan of country music?

627
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.400
I would rather be
your devoted fan for life.

628
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.800
How lucky of me.

629
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.000
I didn't know you were this funny.

630
01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.440
I'm not trying to be funny.

631
01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.240
He's for real.

632
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.840
Mr. Pruek, if you plan to go
to sail your yacht around this time

633
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.880
don't forget to check the weather.

634
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.400
The weather forecast.

635
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.720
The weather forecast, for sure.

636
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.800
If you want to go to

637
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.480
-Maan-nok Island.
-Maan-nok Island?

638
01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.920
-Maan-nai Island?
-Maan-nai Island.

639
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.840
Or Samed island.

640
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.960
Samed island, where everybody relaxes.

641
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.280
Yes, let me know.

642
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.560
All right?

643
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.480
Totally.

644
01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:20.439
Pleng, you're just in time.

645
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.560
Come and try this on.

646
01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:33.160
Why can't it be me? Why?

647
01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:51.399
I think this pair is a bit too small.

648
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.040
Then please try this one.

649
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.160
It's a perfect fit.

650
01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:06.240
Yes, perfect.

651
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.800
You could have called
and asked me for my size.

652
01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:16.760
But then it wouldn't be a surprise.

653
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.520
It's a small price to make you happy.

654
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.399
There is so much more I can do for you.

655
01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:24.319
Okay.

656
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.160
Will it be okay, if I don't accept this?

657
01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.319
Why not?

658
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.840
This pair is just like the one that broke.

659
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.840
Yes, it is.

660
01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.160
But Pruek...

661
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.080
Yes?

662
01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:56.200
Can we just go back
to being teacher and student?

663
01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.960
Why?

664
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.320
My mom went to see a fortune-teller.

665
01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.240
She said...

666
01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.600
I shouldn't date someone
who was born in the same month.

667
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.360
It's really bad luck.

668
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.160
Remember?

669
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:27.960
Yes.

670
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.800
Sore feet?

671
01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.960
Let me give you a massage.

672
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.120
Just relax. No need to be uptight.

673
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.960
It cracked too.

674
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.320
Didn't I answer correctly?
Why did you punch me?

675
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.160
I didn't get a chance to answer.
What's wrong with you?

676
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320
I can't take it anymore!

677
01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.720
Come on. Hold on.

678
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.040
Come on.

679
01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.760
Do you feel better?

680
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.280
Much better.

681
01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.760
What's wrong?

682
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.400
I want to break up with my boyfriend.

683
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.840
Damn. She punches hard
like Manny Pacquiao.

684
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Hey. Where are you going?

685
01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.320
There is a crazy guy
who closed down the coffee shop.

686
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.040
Translate.

687
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.960
It means run!

688
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.120
Don't tell me that he is...

689
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.200
Yes, that's him!

690
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.000
Is that a bouquet of flowers
or a manhole cover?

691
01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.200
You are not done yet.
You got to say one last thing.

692
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.760
You will regret it,
if you don't choose me.

693
01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.880
Isn't this sentence a bit over the top?
I will get kicked instead of picked.

694
01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.920
It's okay. It fits you.

695
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.360
Have some self-confidence.
It's your selling point.

696
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.560
Let's continue, okay?

697
01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.640
Almost.

698
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.120
but that is number...

699
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.240
235.

700
01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.240
I thought the key word is pressure?

701
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.960
Yes, but what I asked you just now
was pressure as in the force

702
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.360
not as in the stress you feel.

703
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.080
Talk about pressure, here he comes now.

704
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920
Did he see me?

705
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.520
He didn't even look over here yet.

706
01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.680
Just be straight with him.

707
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.720
Breaking his heart would be like
running over a little puppy.

708
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.960
Come on. It won't kill him.

709
01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.120
I thought I would surprise you.

710
01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.240
How are you, Pleng? Feeling better?

711
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.440
Ms. Tui said you were not feeling well.

712
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.840
I'm feeling better now.

713
01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.400
That's good. I bought some dinner for us.

714
01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:26.920
Let's go.

715
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.000
What a mess. My room is such a mess.

716
01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.960
That's good. I can help.

717
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.560
You are not feeling well.

718
01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.600
It's okay. I...

719
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960
What's going on?

720
01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.760
Is this the guy?

721
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520
Who are you?

722
01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.800
What?

723
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.040
Come on. Let's go up.

724
01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.040
Excuse me.

725
01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240
Who are you?

726
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.480
I'm her husband.

727
01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.480
I...

728
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.760
What is going on?

729
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.240
It hasn't been a month
since we started dating.

730
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.960
Come. Let's go.

731
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.760
How could you say
that you were my husband?

732
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.640
I was trying to help.

733
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.320
I don't know if I should thank you or not.

734
01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.400
And what did you whisper in his ear?
He looked totally shocked.

735
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.440
I told him...

736
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.280
I knocked you up.

737
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.760
What!

738
01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.280
You made me seem slutty!

739
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.920
What were you thinking?

740
01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:36.960
Do you even care?

741
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.360
That's slutty! So slutty!

742
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.720
I'm leaving.

743
01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.400
Hey! Where are you going?
Why don't you use the elevator?

744
01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.320
If he is still freaking out down there
then our plan will be exposed.

745
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.040
Bye.

746
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.520
-Hello. What's up?
-Hello. Where are you? I'm here already, buying coffee.

747
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.080
Let's just go. There is no time.

748
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.240
We will make it.
Taking my bike only takes a second.

749
01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.040
What are you wearing?

750
01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.120
I told you to dress up nice.

751
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.720
I did. Here.

752
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.600
Is this what you are planning to wear?

753
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.720
Yes.

754
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.000
You told me to wear something
I'd wear to a wedding party.

755
01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.400
This is what I wear to every party.

756
01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.840
Hey! Wait.

757
01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.560
Don't tell me you've never
bought a dress shirt.

758
01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.960
The paper is still there.

759
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.440
Why didn't you say something?

760
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.800
When you're about to get into a fight,
you aren't afraid.

761
01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.280
I'm a player not a fighter.

762
01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.800
Whatever you are,
if you don't start talking,

763
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.240
you will never learn to speak.

764
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.240
No excuses. I got you here already.

765
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:28.160
Today you have to talk
to at least three foreigners.

766
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.320
Understand?

767
01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960
How could I?
They speak so fast like they are rapping.

768
01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.880
Spot the key words.

769
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.480
See you.

770
01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.960
Look at that. How lame.

771
01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.160
We can speak Thai just fine.
What was up with that apology?

772
01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.120
Seriously, he's a maintenance engineer.
Dumbass!

773
01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.560
Yes, I know.

774
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.640
Your mom has nice shoulders.

775
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.520
Are you sure you are excited?

776
01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.400
Who are you?

777
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.240
Whose cute kid is that?

778
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.520
Wow. He really only dances at big parties.

779
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.880
I want to thank everyone who honored me
by coming here tonight.

780
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.880
And I want to also thank
our beautiful interpreter, Ms. Pleng.

781
01:23:59.000 --> 01:23:59.840
Thank you.

782
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.680
-Okay. See you next time. Bye.
-See you

783
01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.000
Do you want to take off first?

784
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.720
It's okay. I can wait.

785
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.680
Why don't you put them on?

786
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.560
It broke. It wasn't fixed right.

787
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.560
Hold them for me please.

788
01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.760
Thanks.

789
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.320
Did you understand what they said?
Or are you just clapping along?

790
01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.240
I understood.

791
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.040
Good evening.

792
01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.280
Wow.

793
01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.080
I can translate the whole song.

794
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.840
Tonight...

795
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.920
Something about two.

796
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.040
Forget means we can't remember.

797
01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.560
Open your eyes means have a look.

798
01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.760
That's correct. Have some confidence.

799
01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.120
Your...

800
01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.320
dress is beautiful.

801
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.480
Thank you.

802
01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.160
It sounded like “Do Do Look Look”.
I don't know.

803
01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.760
No. Listen carefully.

804
01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.720
Do you want me to walk you home?

805
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.440
I have a mean dog at home.

806
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.160
Don't help me on this one.

807
01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160
I think I need help.

808
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.040
I will always be yours. I promise.

809
01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.400
Tonight, can I walk you home?

810
01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.680
Morning.

811
01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.480
Before we go back to reality...

812
01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.240
where you go your own way.

813
01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.040
Can you tell me
if you feel the same way too?

814
01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.000
I fixed it.

815
01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:52.760
Please tell me how you feel

816
01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:01.920
'Cause deep inside I know it's real

817
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:11.360
I promise I will forever be yours.

818
01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.080
I got to go.

819
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:18.040
Darling open up to me.

820
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:24.400
Let me walk you home.

821
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.520
Even if you will never be mine.

822
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:38.600
I'm in love with you tonight.

823
01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.960
Why are you home so late?

824
01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.120
You have that test tomorrow.

825
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.680
Are you crazy? My test is next month.

826
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.480
Really?

827
01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:06.520
Because I helped set up the room today.

828
01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.800
Shit! June isn't the seventh month?

829
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.760
Seventh month is correct.
The talking dictionary is wrong for sure.

830
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.400
You're right.

831
01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.840
What the hell!

832
01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.840
Everyone on this planet uses one.
I'm just stupid!

833
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.640
Stop being such an ass kisser.

834
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.320
I'm always to blame.

835
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:41.960
Hello, Pleng.

836
01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.120
Calm down.

837
01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.960
Okay. You can come over.

838
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.800
I'm sorry.

839
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.160
It's my fault for being dumb.

840
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.640
You remembered all of this?

841
01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.200
Yes.

842
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.680
Nothing else to fix, right?

843
01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.520
Pleng.

844
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.040
Go sit on the other side.

845
01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.160
I don't want Kaya to see you
and misunderstand.

846
01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.200
What did she say?

847
01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.160
She still wants you to go.

848
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:10.760
That's all.

849
01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.640
I heard she said...

850
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.520
Do you like me?

851
01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.680
Do you still want to take your test?

852
01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:52.800
I have my heart set on it.

853
01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.360
I have to.

854
01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.080
I know.

855
01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.120
How can a tutor like me

856
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.360
get involved with a student?

857
01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.280
She said she wants the ring back.

858
01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.320
Today I will go first.

859
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.600
I admit I'm hurt...

860
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.520
but being straight forward
like this helps.

861
01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.840
There is something I want to clear up.

862
01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.600
I am not pregnant.

863
01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.760
What made you think

864
01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.960
that I think you are pregnant?

865
01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.240
That day at my condo...

866
01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.920
that guy whispered that to you.

867
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.520
He actually said...

868
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.400
Leave you alone.

869
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.800
You are his girl.

870
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.640
He always talks nonsense.

871
01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.520
Do you remember my story
about the mole and destiny?

872
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.040
I do.

873
01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.600
My mole

874
01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:18.880
will have to set up
a new date with destiny.

875
01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.120
Did that take a long time to come up with?

876
01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.040
But I think you may
have found your destiny.

877
01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.360
HEARTBREAK SONG

878
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.520
KAYA SAID TO MEMORIZE THE NAME
OF THE JAPANESE FOUNDER

879
01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.440
Noda Toichi.

880
01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.320
Shit. Is it something to do
with people or machinery?

881
01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:15.200
You are not done yet.
You got to say one last thing.

882
01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.080
You will regret it if you don't choose me.

883
01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.600
You will regret it if you don't choose me.

884
01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.560
Wait!

885
01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.680
What?

886
01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.240
It's for you.

887
01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.240
Miss.

888
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:45.880
Somebody left this for you.

889
01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.640
Pleng, the interview result is out.

890
01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:57.640
I didn't make it.

891
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.200
I really wanted to pass my interview
to make you proud.

892
01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.240
What is name of our company's founder?

893
01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:09.920
Doraemon.

894
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.400
You know I don't know
how to talk nicely to anyone.

895
01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.640
Well...

896
01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.320
Just have a listen.

897
01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.560
I don't love her you know.

898
01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.760
I just wanted to treat a girl right.

899
01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.840
for once.

900
01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.640
That's all.

901
01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.360
And she just happened to
walk into my life at that moment.

902
01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:40.280
Damn! I am so freaking dumb.

903
01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.880
That gear ring,
I flushed it down the toilet already.

904
01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:50.200
I'm sorry for not telling you in person.

905
01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.440
Anyway...

906
01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.360
I am such an asshole.

907
01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.920
I wanted to ask you...

908
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.880
if I want to tell Kaya that
I don't want to go see her anymore,

909
01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.320
how do I say that in English?

910
01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:48.120
If that's all you wanted to ask,
you could have just called.

911
01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:52.920
Pleng.

912
01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:55.360
I can

913
01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.600
break up with a girl through a phone call.

914
01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:03.200
But I cannot tell a girl
that I like her through the phone.

915
01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.840
I want to see your face
when I tell you that I like you.

916
01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.240
So...

917
01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.240
Do you

918
01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:20.720
feel

919
01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:22.560
the same way?

920
01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.840
Why are you crying? What does that mean?

921
01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.320
Don't cry.

922
01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.880
How far have you listened to?

923
01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.800
As a maintenance engineer,

924
01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.760
I believe everything can be fixed
and made to work again.

925
01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.160
No matter how hard it is to fix

926
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.440
I will always find a way.

927
01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.080
I will be very sad if you don't choose me.

928
01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:28.720
Translate please.

929
01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:33.360
Come here.

930
01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:34.840
Come here.

931
01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.360
DANCE SONG

932
01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:32.280
The State of O-ha-o.
I used to live in O-ha-o.

933
01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.720
Okay. A new state.

934
01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.160
They have their own anthem too.

935
01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.520
Never heard of this O-ha-o state.

936
01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:37.720
Have they got a state song too?

937
01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.840
What does it sound like?

938
01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.920
Just like that. Can you sing?

939
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:47.960
Yes, of course.

940
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.280
Never heard this type of accent before!

941
01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:59.360
Okay, let's eat. She wants some milk.

942
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.320
Okay, let's eat. She wants some milk.

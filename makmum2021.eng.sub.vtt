From an award-winning short film "Makmum"
by Riza Pahlevi

2
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.710
It's hard to lose someone you love.

3
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.050
But if we don't acknowledge the feeling

4
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.590
we would only prolong our sorrow.

5
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.130
It's okay to cry when you're sad.

6
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.090
That's normal.

7
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.460
Listeners, remember

8
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.420
there's always light after darkness.

9
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.550
No matter how deep
our sadness right now

10
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.550
we'll get through it.

11
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.420
My last tip is

12
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.880
be true to your feeling.

13
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.250
Rin, it's me, Alif.

14
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.420
Alif?

15
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.460
I have bad news. Aunt Yanti has died.

16
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.380
Come here, please.

17
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.750
Okay.

18
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.420
Thank you, Lif.

19
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.210
You're welcome.

20
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.960
Entirely we belong to Allah
and entirely to Allah do we return.

21
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.420
Are we there yet?

22
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.630
We've been on the road since yesterday.

23
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.750
And we had to get
on this nauseous minibus.

24
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.090
- Pandaan!
- Stop here, please.

25
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.920
- A customer for me.
- There will be a lot of customers.

26
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.090
Be careful.

27
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.250
Would you get off for a while, please?

28
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.380
What's wrong?

29
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.000
The bridge's old.

30
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.960
- Come on, Fiz.
- You need to understand.

31
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.380
It's been a year since it rained.

32
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.340
Watch out, you can fall.

33
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.960
Watch your step, Fiz.

34
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.050
Are you a native of Suayan Village?

35
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.170
- I am. Why do you ask?
- Nothing.

36
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.750
I just think it's weird.

37
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.210
Other villages love it
when they're progressing.

38
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.300
It's not like that with your village.

39
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.590
No electricity, no signal.

40
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.050
How do people live there?

41
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.710
Suayan Village

42
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.130
It's not going to be long,
ladies and gentlemen

43
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.050
before you can watch TV
and use a cellphone.

44
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.250
You won't need to draw water anymore
from a well.

45
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.380
Our lives will be more comfortable
with electricity.

46
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.130
Enough, enough.

47
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.300
Don't make it hard on yourself.

48
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.420
You're the fifth staff to come here.

49
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.960
Aren't you bored forcing us
to install electricity?

50
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.420
Enough, Dika.

51
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.460
People, do you hate it now?

52
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.460
Is it hard for you?

53
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.050
Do you want to watch TV?

54
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.550
No.

55
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.050
Do you want to use a cellphone?

56
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.050
No.

57
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.050
No.

58
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.710
That's our answer.

59
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.880
To you, maybe we're suffering.

60
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.300
In reality, we live sufficiently here.

61
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.840
We can eat from our own garden.

62
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.670
We can meet others in our village.

63
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.170
And the most important thing

64
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.130
we can focus on our prayer.

65
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.710
Forget this.

66
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.080
Someone has died in our village.

67
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.090
We're in mourning.

68
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.170
Okay then, Mr. Ustadz.

69
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.420
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

70
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.380
- Peace be upon you.
- And also with you.

71
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.000
Let us go home now.

72
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.630
We'll go to late Mrs. Yanti's place
together later.

73
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.750
Okay, sir.

74
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.880
Right.

75
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.880
Go home.

76
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.630
Hey, Ki.

77
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.920
You have the same opinion as me, right?

78
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.210
- You still want to know my opinion?
- I do.

79
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.550
You asked my opinion before

80
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000
but you still cut the tree
near the mosque.

81
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.550
- But that's...
- Enough.

82
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.130
This village can actually
get with the times.

83
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.590
When will we stop falling behind?

84
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.920
But it's for the good of the people.

85
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.800
The people are influenced by you.

86
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.090
Sir...

87
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.210
What?

88
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.670
Think about it again.

89
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.750
You heard it yourself

90
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.380
what the people want.

91
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.960
Everyone would accept it if you accept it.

92
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.550
You're our elder.

93
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.920
Don't make our village go through
a drought like the other villages.

94
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.380
The river and the well is getting dirtier

95
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.920
although we still have many trees here.

96
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.300
We need a water pump to get clean water.
And we need electricity.

97
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.630
This is for the future of our village.

98
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.500
With electricity,
there would be a road outside.

99
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.776
It'll be easier for us
to sell our crops to outsiders.

100
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.550
Now, that's what I'm afraid of, Lif.

101
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.090
Who will benefit from this? Us or them?

102
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.050
You see how it is
with our neighboring village.

103
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.300
It was the same. They got help at first.

104
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.670
Everything got built.

105
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.090
Then what?

106
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.630
They were expelled from their own farm.

107
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.800
Alif...

108
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.170
We've lived here for generations.

109
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.710
The dry season always comes
and everything's always fine.

110
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.300
It's the cycle of nature.

111
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.630
Be patient, okay?

112
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.590
Mrs. Yanti's death is abnormal.

113
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.920
It's because she entered
the Forbidden Forest.

114
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.750
I think so.

115
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.880
It is said that she was taken
by Nyi Lawe there.

116
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.460
Don't say the name "Nyi Lawe". Taboo.

117
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.550
- My condolences.
- Thanks.

118
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.090
My condolences.

119
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.050
Let her go.

120
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.170
Thank you.

121
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.380
- Rin?
- I'm leaving, okay?

122
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.840
Lif.

123
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.500
- Is he Hafiz?
- He is.

124
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.380
Thanks for letting us know.

125
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.090
No problem.

126
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.210
Where did you get a signal?

127
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.340
How did you call us with your cellphone?

128
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.800
At the neighboring village.

129
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.340
Why is there no signal?

130
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.130
There's none here.

131
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.340
What's your activity now?

132
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.810
Are you still managing the boarding house?

133
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.340
I'm still the head of the boarding house.

134
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.710
I'm also managing a small online shop.

135
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.960
Where's your husband?

136
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.090
Will he join you here?

137
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.710
He has died three years ago.

138
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.130
Sorry, I didn't know.

139
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.920
Relax.

140
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.210
When did you return to the Suayan Village?

141
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.130
About three years ago.

142
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.660
Did you not like it in the city?

143
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.960
They're build a new mosque?

144
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.210
- They are.
- What's wrong with the old one?

145
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.630
Isn't it still fine?

146
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.090
That's what they want.

147
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.250
I prefer the installation
of electricity, but...

148
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.340
Hafiz!

149
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.090
Hafiz!

150
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.880
You can go anywhere,
but don't come in here.

151
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.050
Why?

152
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.590
It's the Forbidden Forest.

153
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.210
It's a no-go for people here.

154
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.960
Come on now.

155
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.500
Do you miss your dad?

156
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.250
I am.

157
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.300
Let's pray

158
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.000
so that he's in peace.

159
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.300
What's wrong with you?

160
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.130
I miss him too.

161
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.130
Sometimes I miss him too much

162
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.840
it makes me anxious.

163
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.300
I get...

164
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.130
What, Mother?

165
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.300
Oh, God.

166
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.170
What's wrong?

167
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.380
Nothing, sweetie.

168
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.090
Fiz, promise me

169
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.840
that you will do salat diligently

170
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.840
so your prayers
can bring your father to heaven.

171
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.550
How long will we stay here?

172
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.590
We won't be long. After I take care
of your grandma's belongings

173
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.290
and do the Seventh Day of Death prayer,
we'll go home.

174
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.380
Oh, no. A week?

175
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.550
No electricity, no signal.

176
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.130
I can't use my phone.

177
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.380
Right.

178
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.630
Mrs. Lastri said her son, Iwan,
asked you to play with him.

179
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.540
Play with him tomorrow, okay?

180
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.920
Should I?

181
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.630
I seek forgiveness in God.

182
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.710
God, forgive me
for not concentrating on my prayer.

183
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.710
Oh, God!

184
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.380
Rini...

185
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.630
She won't let me.

186
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.590
It's late. Tomorrow, okay?

187
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.630
Rini...

188
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.090
I seek forgiveness in God...

189
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.090
Oh, God...

190
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.880
Hafiz.

191
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.340
Murky.

192
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.090
Excuse me.

193
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.840
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you too.

194
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.550
Rin, hold on, okay?

195
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.340
Hold this. Wait.

196
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.750
That.

197
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.750
Prettier this way.

198
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.420
What's up?

199
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.340
Is the water dirty here now?

200
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.250
It is. It's been two months.

201
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.500
It wasn't like this.

202
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.380
Murky water although
we experience no drought.

203
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.460
But the water's only murky
in this village.

204
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.380
But thank God it can still be used.

205
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.340
Why are you here?

206
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.000
I'm in the middle of making palm sugar.

207
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.840
We need to get water from far away now.

208
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.590
Distant.

209
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.750
But what else can we do?

210
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.740
I can only accept the situation.

211
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.130
- Beat me!
- Wait!

212
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:39.710
Beat me!

213
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.170
- Beat me if you can!
- Wait!

214
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.750
Beat me!

215
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.460
You're cheating!

216
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.130
Don't accuse me, I didn't mean to do it.

217
00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.460
No way! I saw it!

218
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.380
I'm telling your grandparents!

219
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.750
Stop fighting.

220
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.670
- Snitch!
- What snitch?

221
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.960
Wait for me!

222
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.420
When did it become like this?

223
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.130
I don't know.
It was like this when we arrived.

224
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.550
- Was it the mortar?
- No way.

225
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.090
Come here.

226
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.550
That's the sand, the brick,
and the cement.

227
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.090
They're all super quality.

228
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.130
No way it's because of the mortar.

229
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.670
I win, Grandpa!

230
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.710
- You win?
- He cheated, sir!

231
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.250
What?

232
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.050
- My grandson cheated?
- I did not.

233
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.920
- Honestly?
- He did.

234
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.880
Dusk is coming, okay?

235
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.210
Go home. You'll do your prayer
and you'll recite Qur'an. Okay?

236
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.500
Let's play again, okay?

237
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.920
No way! You'll cheat again.

238
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.590
Just go home now.

239
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.250
Don't go there. Hey!

240
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.000
Don't go there, I'm telling you.

241
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.420
Hey What's your name?

242
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.300
Just let him go.

243
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.050
Isn't it forbidden?

244
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.380
Just be silent.

245
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.250
Let's come home.

246
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.170
Don't think about it.

247
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.670
Let's do salat, then recite Qur'an.

248
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.750
- Hafiz.
- Mother.

249
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.340
- Don't use too much water.
- Okay.

250
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.880
A kid was entering the forest.

251
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.920
Who?

252
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.170
- Iwan?
- No.

253
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.300
- Afdal?
- No.

254
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.460
- Who, then?
- That limp boy.

255
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.920
Well, you still can't go into the forest.
Got it?

256
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.500
Come on, it's Maghrib time.

257
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.710
The mosque we've been building
since a month ago

258
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:13.670
still needs our help.

259
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.050
Understand, ladies and gents?

260
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.670
Yes.

261
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.590
What happened?

262
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.840
The wall cracks.

263
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.630
Amen.

264
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.840
Mother!

265
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.880
Mother!

266
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.300
Mother!

267
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.420
Rin, your kid, on the front.

268
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.380
- What's wrong with Hafiz?
- Come!

269
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.670
Hafiz?

270
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.710
Hafiz, wake up.

271
00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.880
Wake up.

272
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.300
Hafiz, wake up.

273
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.130
Watch your step.

274
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.590
Istighfar...

275
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.880
Hafiz? Hafiz!

276
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.726
- Oh God, what's wrong with him? Hafiz!
- He passed out.

277
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.590
Hafiz? Wake up, son.

278
00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.590
Your mother's here. Hafiz.

279
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.460
Hafiz, wake up.
What's wrong with you? Wake up!

280
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.210
Hafiz?

281
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.800
- What's wrong with you?
- Mother!

282
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.670
Thank God.

283
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.840
Let's go home.

284
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.000
I don't want to be here. Please!

285
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.550
Okay, we're going home tomorrow.
I promise you.

286
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.250
Really?

287
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.500
Calm down, son.

288
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.210
I'm scared.

289
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.840
You have me and Allah. Calm down.

290
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.800
Hafiz!

291
00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.420
- Hafiz?
- Hafiz!

292
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.630
Ma'am, is Hafiz here?

293
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.840
Hafiz!

294
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.000
Fiz, let's play!

295
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.840
Fiz, let's play.

296
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.800
Hafiz, play with your friends first, okay?

297
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.670
When Uncle Alif comes, I'll call you.

298
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.000
Come!

299
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.800
Hom Pim Pa,
the different one will be the seeker.

300
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.500
You're it, Hafiz.

301
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.670
Don't cheat, okay?

302
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.800
Okay!

303
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.170
- Count! Count correctly!
- That's right!

304
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.250
- Okay?
- Okay.

305
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.090
Seven.

306
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.420
Six.

307
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.630
Five.

308
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.300
- Make it smooth.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.630
Three.

310
00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.380
Two.

311
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.000
One.

312
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.300
Touch!

313
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.800
There he is.

314
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.130
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you too.

315
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.130
Lif, thank you for taking us back.

316
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.670
Sorry to bother you.

317
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.250
It's okay.

318
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.590
I want to buy something anyway
for my grandfather.

319
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.210
How is he anyway? Healthy?

320
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.800
Too healthy.

321
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.380
He's more active as he gets older.

322
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.920
I still remember when we were kids,
he always told us about

323
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.050
his great grandfather
who founded this village.

324
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.840
Well, that story?

325
00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.840
I listen to that almost every day.

326
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.550
Look at my ear.

327
00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.050
It's hairy now because of that.

328
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.090
Where does he live now?

329
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.210
He doesn't get along with the people here.

330
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.960
He chooses to seclude himself.

331
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.250
I feel the same.

332
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.880
I feel there's something weird.

333
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.300
Weird?

334
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.630
Don't think weird thoughts.

335
00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.460
Maybe Hafiz isn't used to the darkness,
that's all.

336
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.130
Oh, right...

337
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.750
Do you know who that limp boy is?

338
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.090
Limp?

339
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.000
Hafiz told me that they played
and the boy went into the forest.

340
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.920
Iwan and Afdal...

341
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.460
As far as I know, their legs are fine.

342
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:23.960
Maybe there's another kid.

343
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.800
None. Only them.

344
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.670
Hafiz?

345
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.960
Hafiz? Sir, do you see the kids?

346
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.670
They were playing around here.

347
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.170
But they're not here now.

348
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.476
- What's wrong?
- I believe the kids go into the forest.

349
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.170
No way. They're playing around here.

350
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.300
Hafiz!

351
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.630
Hafiz?

352
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.170
Hafiz?

353
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.500
Hafiz?

354
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.880
Hafiz?

355
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.550
Hafiz?

356
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.090
Aisyah.

357
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.170
Aisyah! Lastri!

358
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.000
Rin?

359
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.090
Hafiz?

360
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.880
Hafiz?

361
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.750
Rini...

362
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.960
Hafiz!

363
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.000
Hafiz!

364
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.840
Iwan... Hafiz!

365
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.210
Iwan! Oh, God!

366
00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.050
Hafiz!

367
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.550
Hafiz!

368
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.250
- Hafiz!
- Rin!

369
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.800
- Hafiz!
- Afdal! Rin!

370
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.800
- Oh, God!
- Hafiz!

371
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.250
- Oh, God! Iwan!
- Wake up, son.

372
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.590
Wan...

373
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.710
- Hafiz?
- Wake up, son!

374
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.920
- Sweetie!
- Oh, God!

375
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.380
- Hafiz!
- Afdal!

376
00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.130
It's because of the spirits.

377
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.476
They went into the Forbidden Forest,
that's why they're angry.

378
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.170
It's just a story.

379
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.300
Tales of old.

380
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.130
Don't believe such things.

381
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.250
It's shirk. It's a sin.

382
00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.130
I'm going to bring Hafiz home.

383
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.550
- Let him be.
- Rin.

384
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.750
- Sir, let him be.
- Sir.

385
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.460
Oh, God!

386
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.170
You have to eat a lot

387
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.130
for you to get well.

388
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.340
I'm making you your favorite porridge.

389
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.130
Eat up.

390
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.960
Open your mouth.

391
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:01.170
Drink, son.

392
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.250
Drink it. Oh, God.

393
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.120
I'm going to get a napkin, okay?

394
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.050
Oh, God.

395
00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.880
I seek forgiveness in God.

396
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.550
Iwan? Son?

397
00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.420
Oh, God!

398
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.210
Hafiz?

399
00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.500
Hafiz?

400
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.840
Hafiz?

401
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.590
Hafiz? Where are you? Hafiz?

402
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.210
Hafiz?

403
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.420
Hafiz?

404
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.250
Hafiz?

405
00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:59.130
Hafiz?

406
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.550
- Mother!
- Wait for me!

407
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:03.920
- I can't swim!
- Oh, God!

408
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.050
- Mother!
- Hafiz!

409
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.920
- Hold your breath!
- Mother!

410
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.380
- Help me!
- Hold on to this! Hold the rope!

411
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.920
Pull it!

412
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.170
Don't let go!

413
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.420
Hold on to that! Wait for me!

414
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.960
Hafiz!

415
00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.920
Hafiz...

416
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.960
Hafiz?

417
00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.460
Hafiz!

418
00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.550
Hafiz?

419
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.880
Hafiz!

420
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.300
Hafiz!

421
00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.960
Aisyah!

422
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.670
Rin?

423
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.300
- Aisyah.
- Yes, Rin?

424
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.710
Did Afdal ever tell you
about a limp boy?

425
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.670
He did. What's wrong?

426
00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.000
The boy exists, then. Where does he live?

427
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.130
I know everyone in the village
and I know there's no limp boy here.

428
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.210
So, he must've made that up.

429
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.960
I don't think about it much.

430
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:49.170
Aisyah, Iwan and Hafiz see that boy too.

431
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.710
It's not made up, it's real.
The boy's real.

432
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.000
Aisyah!

433
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.000
This could be the beginning
of a danger to us.

434
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.710
Trust me.

435
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.210
Thank you.

436
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.500
Lastri.

437
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.840
How's Iwan doing?

438
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.750
What did I do wrong?

439
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.130
Did Iwan ever tell you about a limp boy?

440
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.130
- He did.
- What did he tell you?

441
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.840
That they were playing together.

442
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.170
The boy doesn't exist.

443
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.210
Iwan got sick last month.

444
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.840
The limp boy was made up to accompany him.

445
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.840
No. Hafiz saw that boy.

446
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.840
Maybe Iwan told him that story.

447
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.630
What's wrong?

448
00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.380
Hafiz told me he saw the boy
go into the forest.

449
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.750
No way. You're overthinking.

450
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.840
Didn't you hear what the Ustadz said?

451
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.420
Las, that limp boy might be the key
to our boys' recovery.

452
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.170
I don't want to get into this.

453
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.500
Las, believe me.

454
00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:21.750
Enough, Rin.

455
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.160
I don't want to get into this.

456
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.090
Go home, Rin.

457
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.130
Rin...

458
00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.500
- The water.
- Thank you, Lif.

459
00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.500
Hafiz?

460
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.710
Hafiz?

461
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:05.670
Sorry, I'm late.

462
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.590
It's okay. So, how is it?

463
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.340
You've read my letter, haven't you?

464
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.090
I have.

465
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.090
And how will it be?

466
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.500
That's the problem.

467
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.050
We can't do it yet.

468
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:25.250
Not yet?

469
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.840
Come on!

470
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.920
Go high!

471
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.050
Go on!

472
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.210
- Hafiz, get down!
- Jump!

473
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.380
- Don't jump!
- Jump!

474
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.130
Hafiz, no!

475
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.670
Hafiz!

476
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.590
Hafiz!

477
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:28.670
Hafiz?

478
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.380
Hafiz and Iwan also have this bruise.

479
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.000
You still don't believe me?

480
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.880
I'm just following what Father says.

481
00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.960
He knows best.

482
00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.750
Help us, Aisyah

483
00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.750
to make the boys recover fast.

484
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.500
What can we do, Rin?

485
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.710
One more thing.

486
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.380
Are you bothered by a makmum lately?

487
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.460
Makmum?

488
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.880
A spirit who disturbs us
when we do our salat.

489
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:31.460
You mean khanzab?

490
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.420
My father will be home soon.

491
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.420
You should leave.

492
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.460
I know.

493
00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:56.630
Lastri!

494
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.050
Hafiz!

495
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.880
Lastri, why did you go
to the new mosque?

496
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.050
Nothing.

497
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.880
You want to see that tree too?

498
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.701
You saw Iwan climbing that tree
in your dream, didn't you?

499
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.500
Did you see him in your dream?

500
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.300
I did.

501
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.840
I don't know what's happening.

502
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.880
I'm baffled.

503
00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.880
I still don't know what causes this.

504
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.840
Rin...

505
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.750
Do you believe ghost exist?

506
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:51.170
Las, you know
I can see spirits since I was a kid.

507
00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.920
But I see them more often lately.

508
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.210
It's as if they want to convey something.

509
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.500
You need to believe me.

510
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:20.800
- Mother?
- Oh, God!

511
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:25.960
- Afdal!
- Thank God!

512
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.550
Oh, God!

513
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.300
Thank God!

514
00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.050
What's happening?

515
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.590
The Ustadz's grandson has recovered.

516
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.340
That's right.

517
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.460
That's why you should believe
in Mr. Ustadz.

518
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.210
Hafiz.

519
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.960
Afdal has awakened.

520
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.550
Come on. Fight it!

521
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.920
Whatever that is, fight it.
You have to be strong!

522
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.090
Fiz...

523
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.670
How can it collapse like this?

524
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.380
It feels like it's hollow.

525
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.340
Maybe.

526
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.090
The ground must be hollow. Hollow.

527
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.420
We should move it

528
00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.050
there.

529
00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:02.130
A tree can grow tall there.

530
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.840
So, the ground must be solid.

531
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.050
No problem. I'll cut the tree.

532
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.000
Mrs. Yanti's death is abnormal.

533
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.300
It's because she entered
the Forbidden Forest.

534
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.300
I think so.

535
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.380
It is said that she was taken
by Nyi Lawe there.

536
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.800
Don't say the name "Nyi Lawe". Taboo.

537
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.670
Peace be upon you.

538
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.500
And upon you too.

539
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.000
I'd like to visit your son.

540
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:40.380
You can go anywhere,
but don't come in here.

541
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.670
It's the Forbidden Forest.

542
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.800
They're wrong, Mother.

543
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.920
- The kid doesn't exist, Rin.
- It was made up by him.

544
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.340
He always told us about his great
grandfather who founded this village.

545
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:14.500
Peace be upon you. Alif?

546
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.670
May I meet your grandfather?

547
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.000
I know you don't believe me

548
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.090
but please give me a chance.

549
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.380
I'm certain this has something to do
with that new mosque.

550
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.300
The makmum spirit usually only disturbs me
when I do my salat.

551
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.800
But since Hafiz has been sick

552
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.800
it appears more often.

553
00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.340
That means it wants to give me a lead.

554
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.590
Please believe me.

555
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.130
Okay, then.

556
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:58.710
When my great grandfather cleared
the forest that becomes this village,

557
00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:02.750
there's a part of the forest
that couldn't be touched.

558
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.090
The Forbidden Forest.

559
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:08.960
It belongs to someone.

560
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.550
It's their home.

561
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.170
They've been there for generations.

562
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.460
So, if something is taken from there

563
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.740
it needs to be put back immediately.

564
00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:30.000
When Mr. Ustadz wanted to build
the mosque near the forest

565
00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:32.500
he asked for my opinion.

566
00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.050
I said, "Be my guest"

567
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.840
as long as he doesn't touch the forest.

568
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.550
And he agreed to that.

569
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.840
You should've been careful.

570
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.050
This costs more money.

571
00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.800
Oh, no. This is a serious injury.

572
00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.300
Is there no medication?

573
00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.500
No.

574
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:02.960
I'll get some from my house, then.

575
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:12.380
Why does she do that? What is she doing?

576
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.750
Hafiz!

577
00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:46.630
Go away!

578
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.710
Go away!

579
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.960
Oh, God! Hafiz!

580
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.750
Hafiz?

581
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.340
Hafiz!

582
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.920
Hafiz!

583
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:14.590
Hafiz!

584
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.880
Hafiz?

585
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.250
Hafiz, wait for me!

586
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.170
Where are you going?

587
00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:26.500
Hafiz, wait for me!

588
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:29.590
Hafiz?

589
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.550
Rini...

590
00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.300
Hafiz!

591
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:19.670
Hafiz.

592
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.210
Hafiz!

593
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:23.130
Hafiz!

594
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:24.710
Hafiz!

595
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.710
- That's Rini.
- Hafiz!

596
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Hafiz, don't go!

597
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.170
Rin, Hafiz is at home.

598
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.500
A spirit.

599
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.750
The spirit of the forest.

600
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.920
The spirit of the forest fooled me.

601
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.340
Turns out the makmum
that has been bothering me is that spirit.

602
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:50.960
It wants to take Hafiz away.

603
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.460
It wants to take Hafiz away.

604
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.090
Hafiz, wake up, son.

605
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:16.710
Hafiz.

606
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.590
Hafiz.

607
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.500
Hafiz, wake up, son.

608
00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.750
Hafiz.

609
00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.050
Sweetie.

610
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.670
- Where are you taking my son?
- To the hospital.

611
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.590
- Without telling me?
- Rin, this is for his well-being.

612
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.420
No, no, no.

613
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:20.130
This is caused by the construction
of the new mosque.

614
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.420
The forest spirit is angry
that the tree behind the mosque was cut.

615
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:26.550
- That's why it took the kids.
- Enough, Rin!

616
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.630
Aren't you worried
about Hafiz's condition?

617
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.250
- Ajis!
- Yes?

618
01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.050
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you too.

619
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.300
Lastri's son has recovered.

620
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.630
Thank God.

621
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.340
I'm going to visit him. Come on.

622
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.840
Rin, listen...

623
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.960
Iwan has recovered.

624
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.130
But why is Hafiz still unconscious?

625
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.460
No, no, no.
I want to settle this myself.

626
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.280
The spirit of the ghost is angry.
It wants to give a warning.

627
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.300
- I need to settle this!
- Rin!

628
01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.920
- Let him go!
- Rin!

629
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.210
Go away!

630
01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.340
Rin!

631
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:13.800
Hafiz.

632
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.840
Hafiz.

633
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.670
- What happens?
- The wall cracks.

634
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.590
They're wrong, Mother.

635
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:35.590
- The kid doesn't exist.
- As long as there's no other tree is cut

636
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:36.920
it will not bother us.

637
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.090
Get back.

638
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:54.590
- No! Don't cut it!
- Get back!

639
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.210
Come on, get back!

640
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.130
No!

641
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.750
Or you'll be dead!

642
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.340
Dead.

643
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.380
Dead.

644
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.800
Dead.

645
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.840
Dead.

646
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.880
- Rin?
- Dead.

647
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.300
Rini?

648
01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.380
Dead.

649
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:42.630
Dead.

650
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:48.710
Death is God's will.

651
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.880
It has nothing to do with a tree.

652
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.750
Get back!

653
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.710
Oh, no!

654
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.750
Thank God.

655
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960
It's done, Mr. Ustadz.

656
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.590
Thank you.

657
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.880
Mother!

658
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:32.840
Mother!

659
01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.380
- Hafiz!
- Mother!

660
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:38.210
Hafiz has recovered?

661
01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:40.500
Oh, God!

662
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.880
You have recovered.

663
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.590
It doesn't make sense.

664
01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:49.130
It has been weird.

665
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.460
Look at Rini.

666
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.000
- Everyone...
- Yes, sir?

667
01:03:56.090 --> 01:04:00.300
- We're relieved.
- Thank God.

668
01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.710
Thank God. And now, please go home.

669
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:04.710
Let's go home.

670
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800
Okay, sir.

671
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:14.670
Rin?

672
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:26.170
A charity is still a charity.

673
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.650
But don't go broke because of that.

674
01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.250
How can worship make you go broke?

675
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:45.750
Rini?

676
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.130
Wait, boss. Where are you going?

677
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.420
This is an adult matter.

678
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.750
Just go to sleep.

679
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.460
Don't forget the bed.

680
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:57.130
Bed. I'll shoot you. Go away.

681
01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:02.710
Rini.

682
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.210
Where are you going?

683
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.170
Why are leaving?

684
01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.340
Rin?

685
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.630
This must be a code for me.

686
01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:29.380
- Rini!
- Ladies and gentlemen

687
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.380
thank you for coming here

688
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.000
for the Seventh Day of Mrs. Yanti's death.

689
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.800
Rini's here.

690
01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.750
Where's Hafiz?

691
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:46.300
Is he with Alif?

692
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.170
Rini.

693
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.250
Rini.

694
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:59.170
Rini...

695
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.420
Where are you going?

696
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:05.130
Why are you hanging out here
instead of praying for Mrs. Yanti?

697
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:08.880
Let me accompany you.

698
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.460
She accepts.

699
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.880
Rini.

700
01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.000
Hi, Rini.

701
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:07.210
Where are you going?

702
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.500
Just stay here. There's a gorge there.

703
01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:17.670
What about your son? Will he be okay?

704
01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:26.420
Your son's smart. He's understanding.

705
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.000
How beautiful you are.

706
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.840
I'm going to kiss your hand, okay?

707
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.800
Wait, why is your hand black?

708
01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.840
Sh♪t!

709
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:03.670
Mother, help!

710
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:08.670
Hafiz?

711
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:10.840
Hafiz!

712
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:12.550
Hafiz?

713
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.170
Where's Hafiz?

714
01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.840
Hafiz?

715
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.920
Where's Hafiz? Hafiz?

716
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.500
Rin, what's happening?

717
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:42.750
Rin, you said he's with Alif.

718
01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.380
I don't remember anything.

719
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:46.670
Last I saw him, he was in his room.

720
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.380
- Hafiz!
- Istighfar.

721
01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.500
Hafiz...

722
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.800
Hafiz...

723
01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:58.710
Rin, the jinn is using you.

724
01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.670
Sir, I had a vision
that Hafiz is being taken to the forest.

725
01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:07.840
- Come on! We have to save him!
- Say God's name.

726
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.960
No, Rin.

727
01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.460
Istighfar, Rin.

728
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.590
Rin, Istighfar.

729
01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:19.090
- I seek forgiveness in God.
- Istighfar.

730
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.050
Calm down.

731
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.750
Don't be affected.

732
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.250
Don't be fooled.

733
01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:17.750
Don't disturb!

734
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:19.840
My house is damage!

735
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:24.210
Oh, God!

736
01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.000
Oh, God!

737
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:46.300
Hafiz...

738
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:52.380
Hafiz...

739
01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:54.590
- Hafiz!
- Uncle!

740
01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:57.670
I'm scared.

741
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.960
What's wrong?

742
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.420
Mom's weird.

743
01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.300
Rini!

744
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:11.710
Come on. Let's go home.

745
01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.420
Okay.

746
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:20.380
Rini!

747
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:25.460
- Rini!
- Aunt Rini!

748
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.750
- Rini!
- Aunt Rini!

749
01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.050
Rini?

750
01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:33.630
- Aunt Rini!
- Rini?

751
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.000
Sir, what's happening?

752
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:39.670
Rini's running away. She's possessed.

753
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.750
- Possessed?
- She is!

754
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.050
- Let's split up and find her!
- Okay!

755
01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:46.880
Come on!

756
01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.750
Rini!

757
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.130
- Rini!
- Mother!

758
01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:54.750
Rini?

759
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.130
- Mother?
- Aunt Rini?

760
01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:00.630
Rini!

761
01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:03.800
Rini?

762
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.380
- Aunt Rini!
- Mother!

763
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:09.250
- Aunt Rini?
- Rini!

764
01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.670
- Sir, I know where she is.
- Where?

765
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:14.590
- Aunt Rini!
- Mother!

766
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.000
- Rini!
- Mother!

767
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.800
Rini?

768
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.250
- Mother!
- Aunt Rini!

769
01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.210
- Mother!
- Oh, dear! Rin!

770
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.800
Oh, God! Wake up, Rin!

771
01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.420
Rin?

772
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:50.880
- Oh, God!
- Mother!

773
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.460
Rin?

774
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:55.340
I seek forgiveness in God.

775
01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:59.050
- Rin, wake up!
- Mother!

776
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.380
Mother!

777
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.050
- Hafiz!
- Mother!

778
01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:14.800
Mother!

779
01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:31.750
Wake up, Rin!

780
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.880
Wake up, Rin!

781
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.800
Put the kids down!

782
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.500
It hurts!

783
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:03.300
Rin!

784
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.800
Wake up, Rin!

785
01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:12.750
Enough, Rin. Wake up, Rin.

786
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:17.420
Oh, God!

787
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:22.000
Come on, let's go!

788
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:24.250
Oh, God!

789
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.000
Rini!

790
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:29.840
Mr. Ustadz!

791
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:31.670
Rini?

792
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:34.300
Rini! Oh, God!

793
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.460
Wake up, Rin!

794
01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:40.340
Rini! Wake up, Rin!

795
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.460
Everyone, let's pray together.

796
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:44.670
Yes, sir.

797
01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.130
Rin!

798
01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:07.630
Oh, God, Rin!

799
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:11.710
Father!

800
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:15.500
- Let's go home.
- Oh, God.

801
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.300
Come on, we pray again.

802
01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:23.550
Yes, sir.

803
01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:51.210
Oh, God!

804
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:54.420
Come on, let's pray again.

805
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.670
Let's leave!

806
01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.000
Let's leave!

807
01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:23.340
Hey! Don't leave!

808
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:41.210
Are you scared?

809
01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:48.380
Destroyers!

810
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.340
Alif?

811
01:17:53.170 --> 01:17:55.380
Come with me.

812
01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:10.210
Where are we going?

813
01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:13.960
Those poor kids.

814
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.840
It's okay.

815
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.880
Alif?

816
01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.300
Alif!

817
01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:30.460
Who are you talking to?

818
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.840
Mr. Ajis.

819
01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.460
Where is he?

820
01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:49.750
Hey, hold this. Hurry!

821
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.630
Come on. Don't ramble.

822
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.300
Lif, hurry!

823
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:27.050
Rin, remember! That's your son!

824
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.380
You're possessed by the devil!

825
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.920
Remember, we have Allah!

826
01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.710
Don't be defeated by the devil!

827
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.170
Dead!

828
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.800
Dead!

829
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.800
Hafiz loves you, Mother!

830
01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:27.840
Oh, God.

831
01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:29.750
Oh, God! Rini!

832
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.590
Come on.

833
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.420
- Afdal.
- Hafiz.

834
01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:45.880
- Iwan.
- Afdal.

835
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.800
Son, it's me.

836
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:52.090
Come on.

837
01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:53.840
It's okay, son.

838
01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:03.750
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

839
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.840
Father!

840
01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:00.210
Oh, God!

841
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.880
Keep on praying!

842
01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:11.340
Nyi Lawe's energy is sucked empty by Rini!

843
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.630
Come on, keep on praying!

844
01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:30.880
That's it.

845
01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:32.750
Son...

846
01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.460
Put it in, hurry.

847
01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.670
That's right. Hurry.

848
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.920
Once more.

849
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.380
Over there.

850
01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.550
This, I return your house!

851
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.460
Don't disturb us anymore!

852
01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.250
Allah is the greatest.

853
01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.050
Thank God.

854
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:56.750
Thank God.

855
01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:58.590
Mother!

856
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.250
Mother! Wake up!

857
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:08.710
There's a reason the villagers
call this place The Forbidden Forest.

858
01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:14.210
When it was still a kingdom,
a lot of spirits disturbed the villagers.

859
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.130
And then the spirits are caged
into the trees.

860
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.920
When the villagers disturb the forest

861
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.710
the spirits bother my salat
to send a message

862
01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.880
because sometimes I'm not focused.

863
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:29.880
We need to believe
that we live side by side

864
01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.130
with creatures from another dimension.

865
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.880
We need to be respectful
and take care of one another.

866
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:42.880
Settlement for you and the sky a canopy

867
01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.130
and sends down rain from the sky

868
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:52.670
causing fruits
to grow as a provision for you.

869
01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:58.340
So do not knowingly
set up equals to Allah in worship.

870
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:01.170
Thank you.

871
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:03.590
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you too.

872
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.250
Fiz, let's play together again someday!

873
01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.960
Thank God. It's raining!

874
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:13.250
Thank God!

875
01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:16.460
It's raining!

876
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:24.710
Thank God!

877
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:32.340
I want to thank you
for helping me and Hafiz.

878
01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.106
This place will function
as a religious school

879
01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.630
You'll come here often, right?

880
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:41.420
I don't know.

881
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:44.880
After what happened to me and Hafiz
the other day

882
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.550
I'm traumatized to come back here.

883
01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:58.460
What if I come to your place?

884
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.050
May I?

885
01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:08.630
Of course.

886
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:23.840
Oh, so the old mosque

887
01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:26.550
will become a place to memorize Quran?

888
01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.000
It will be.

889
01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.920
What's wrong?

890
01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:36.130
It reminds me of a friend of mine.

891
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.170
She always want to grow deeper in religion

892
01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:44.750
to be a Quran memorizer.

893
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:51.800
Her name is Ningsih.

894
01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.500
Where is she now?

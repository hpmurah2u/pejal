1
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.807
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

2
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.142
What is this...

3
00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:01.062
Like, I'm here
as often as I can.
I'm working two jobs.

4
00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:03.148
I don't know what else
you want me to do.

5
00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:05.942
Ah, what a wonderful day.

6
00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.028
The sun is out.
The water is shimmering.

7
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.204
Good morning to you, sir.
Would you care
to blow a bubble?

8
00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:25.321
Oliver, we're okay.
We're okay.

9
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.698
What happened?

10
00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:29.826
Can you use
your words, please?

11
00:07:32.203 --> 00:07:33.538
There you go.

12
00:07:38.835 --> 00:07:40.086
Something.

13
00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:43.798
In. House.

14
00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:45.967
Something in house.

15
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.010
That was probably
just a nightmare,

16
00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.931
'cause there's nobody
in the house but your mom
and your dad.

17
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.142
All right. Come here.
Come here.

18
00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:55.560
Come here, come here.

19
00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:58.437
Can you take some
deep breaths for me, huh?

20
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:02.024
Okay. We're gonna do
some deep breaths.

21
00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:03.568
Okay?

22
00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:21.002
He woke up
in the middle
of the night screaming.

23
00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:23.379
I went in there,
I was up for
two hours with him.

24
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:25.339
He's a little boy.

25
00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:27.091
He has nightmares.

26
00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:30.052
It's easy for you to say.
You never go in with him,
It's always me.

27
00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:32.763
I slept through it,
all right? I'm sorry.

28
00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:33.973
Don't do that.

29
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:36.309
Why can't you just admit
that you don't want to help?

30
00:08:36.392 --> 00:08:39.687
I help, okay?
I always help
when I'm awake.

31
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.063
Hey, buddy.

32
00:08:42.148 --> 00:08:43.691
No more nightmares, huh?

33
00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:47.361
I heard you had
a bad dream, bud.
You need a hug?

34
00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.573
I know what the problem is.

35
00:08:52.992 --> 00:08:54.285
Too far away?

36
00:08:56.162 --> 00:08:58.539
Yep. Let's see. 10 feet.

37
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.583
Oh, that's definitely
too far for a hug.

38
00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.126
Well, what do you think
5 feet is?

39
00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:05.630
Yeah. Oh, okay,
a little closer.

40
00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:09.175
- I'm getting the weirdest reading on this thing.
- It just...

41
00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:11.761
Tummy tickles!

42
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.640
Your throne, sire.

43
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:21.938
Are you able to make it
to a speech therapy today?

44
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.733
Oh, sorry, I can't.
I picked up a shift
at the parking lot.

45
00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:28.861
Oh, well, hopefully
you can make one soon, right?

46
00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:30.196
Yeah, for sure.

47
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:32.448
Are.

48
00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:34.992
We.

49
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.745
Moving.

50
00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.622
Are we moving?

51
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.463
You are not moving
anywhere. Okay?

52
00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:49.423
So don't worry.

53
00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:55.805
Today we're gonna start in
with multiplying more
than two numbers.

54
00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:57.390
Not cool, man.

55
00:09:57.473 --> 00:09:59.809
You don't even know
what you're groaning about.

56
00:09:59.892 --> 00:10:00.893
It's not so hard.

57
00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:03.771
If you could multiply
two numbers,
you could multiply three.

58
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:06.190
Make sure you pay attention
to the lesson. Okay?

59
00:10:06.274 --> 00:10:07.858
Anybody
want to take this?

60
00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:10.111
Come on.
You learn by trying.

61
00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:11.570
Nobody?

62
00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:14.365
Oliver?

63
00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:18.577
What do you make
of these three numbers?

64
00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:26.460
The.

65
00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:27.962
Answer.

66
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:29.088
Is.

67
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:30.840
Eight.

68
00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:33.134
The answer is eight.

69
00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:34.927
Not quite.
I see what you did there,
though.

70
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.512
You were adding
instead of multiplying.

71
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.014
Very good try, Oliver.

72
00:10:38.097 --> 00:10:39.932
Anyone else
want to give it a go?

73
00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:41.475
Go ahead. Byron.

74
00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:44.270
How come Oliver still gets
to use his phone in class,

75
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.855
but you took mine away?

76
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.149
He's autistic, dude.

77
00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.817
So he gets
special treatment?

78
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.193
Oliver gets to use his phone

79
00:10:51.277 --> 00:10:54.071
because he wasn't
playing Fortnite during
the Pledge of Allegiance.

80
00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:55.573
Ooh!

81
00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:58.367
Let's get back
to our first pair.

82
00:10:58.451 --> 00:11:01.912
Product of two and four.
Why don't we start there?

83
00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:05.666
Try one of those radioactive
sludge balls you call food?

84
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.169
Next, I suppose you want me
to go square dancing
with Patrick.

85
00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:09.795
Hey, what's up?

86
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.630
Sorry, Patrick.

87
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:13.382
Do you wanna come
hang out with us?

88
00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:19.221
Where?
Oh, uh...

89
00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:22.141
It's just...
I saw something
cool over there.

90
00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:29.732
That way.

91
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:31.275
I'll catch up in a sec.

92
00:12:06.394 --> 00:12:07.895
Friends?

93
00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.694
Hello?

94
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.039
Hey.

95
00:12:27.123 --> 00:12:29.417
I can't believe
he actually fell for it.

96
00:12:29.542 --> 00:12:31.585
Of course he did.
He's such a loser.

97
00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:33.003
Is he having
a heart attack?

98
00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:34.797
He totally is.
We're supposed to call 911.

99
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.591
Dude, dude, listen.
That's just how he talks.

100
00:12:37.675 --> 00:12:39.677
Moaner Boner.

101
00:12:40.845 --> 00:12:43.889
Like,
he can't even talk.
He's always like...

102
00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:51.105
Exactly. Hey,
maybe he's a robot
under his skin.

103
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.816
Moaner Boner
thinks he's special.

104
00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.778
Oh, did you want
to say something?

105
00:12:57.862 --> 00:13:01.157
I can't believe
you used to be friends
with Moaner Boner over here.

106
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.783
My mom made me.
You.

107
00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:05.161
Are.

108
00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:07.663
Very.

109
00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:11.459
You are very ugly.

110
00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:18.466
Who's ugly now?

111
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.428
Come on.

112
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.074
I didn't know
what to think

113
00:13:44.158 --> 00:13:46.619
when I pulled up
and he wasn't there
waiting for me.

114
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:50.623
I went right into
the worst-case scenarios.

115
00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:52.416
Did he get in trouble?

116
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.126
Did someone take him?

117
00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:59.965
And then I found him
just screaming in the field.

118
00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:02.551
That sounds very scary
for both of you.

119
00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:04.887
And he lost
his phone somehow.

120
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.057
I wish he could
explain what happened.

121
00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:10.351
Good.

122
00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:12.853
Now we're gonna try
using our words.

123
00:14:13.646 --> 00:14:16.190
Lost. In. Field.

124
00:14:17.358 --> 00:14:19.485
We're gonna work
on your Fs. Okay?

125
00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.153
Fs can be tricky.

126
00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:22.988
Field.

127
00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.783
Field, can you
try that?

128
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.328
F...
F...

129
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:31.956
F...

130
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.708
F...

131
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:36.418
Oliver,
you can do it.

132
00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:40.172
F...

133
00:14:42.758 --> 00:14:45.386
Okay, good practicing.

134
00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:48.222
Have you
been trying to provide him

135
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:50.849
with social experiences
like we discussed?

136
00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:52.893
Poor guy still doesn't
have any friends.

137
00:14:52.977 --> 00:14:56.814
You said he was hanging out
with your friend's son.

138
00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:00.025
Jennifer's son, Byron.
Yeah.

139
00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:01.944
Yeah, we're not
close anymore.

140
00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:06.365
Okay, so, if you could
make any effort
to help him find friends,

141
00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:09.201
take him to birthday parties,
anything.

142
00:15:09.285 --> 00:15:12.079
It could be a good way
to get him to open up.

143
00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.248
And just like he's trying
to get better at talking,

144
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.916
we have to make sure
we're listening.

145
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.257
Okay, Patrick,
it's all in the technique.

146
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.426
Just go like this.

147
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:26.802
Spin around. Stop!

148
00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:29.763
Double take three times.
One, two, three...

149
00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:32.266
Come on.
Oliver, you gotta
stay with me, okay?

150
00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.118
That's five bucks, please.

151
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.411
Thanks a lot.

152
00:16:11.055 --> 00:16:12.389
Come on.

153
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.785
Ah!

154
00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.673
Oliver,
take that box off.

155
00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:11.008
Whoa, buddy.

156
00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.093
It is time to brush
your teeth.

157
00:18:14.553 --> 00:18:17.097
- He's full of energy tonight.
- Yeah, he is.

158
00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:21.101
Where'd you get that?

159
00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:23.729
It was at the lost and found
at work. Think it just
needs to be charged.

160
00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.356
I guess you like it, huh?

161
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:30.569
Hey, be careful
with the screen.
It's a little cracked.

162
00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:33.280
What?
You know what.

163
00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:34.740
I run around with
our son all day

164
00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.242
and you get to swoop in
and be the hero once again.

165
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:38.327
The hero?

166
00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.227
It's not all presents
and tummy tickles with me
like it is with you.

167
00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:07.481
I just wish I could
take that part of him
and put it in a box

168
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.566
and tape it up
and hide it somewhere,

169
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.151
so we didn't have
to deal with it.

170
00:19:12.611 --> 00:19:14.112
Then he wouldn't be
our Oliver.

171
00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.993
I should have...

172
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.955
I should have
taken him sooner.

173
00:19:25.624 --> 00:19:27.626
What if he never
learns to talk

174
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.711
because I didn't do
anything for so long.

175
00:19:29.795 --> 00:19:31.171
We didn't do anything.

176
00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:36.134
He's never looked me
in the eyes.

177
00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:39.012
Do you know what it's like
for your own child

178
00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:40.973
to never look you
in the eyes?

179
00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.060
Well...

180
00:19:46.395 --> 00:19:48.522
He's got nice eyes,
if that helps.

181
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.402
No, Marty,
it doesn't help.

182
00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:55.821
Because he...
He loves you
and he hates me.

183
00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:43.160
Ow...

184
00:23:29.076 --> 00:23:33.038
Okay, now, how many of you
have played musical
instruments before?

185
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.665
Do instruments
of torture count?
No.

186
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:38.293
Is mayonnaise
an instrument?

187
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:41.213
No, Patrick, mayonnaise
is not an instrument.

188
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:08.615
Is.

189
00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:09.699
Dad.

190
00:24:11.034 --> 00:24:12.035
Gone?

191
00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:16.665
Is Dad gone?

192
00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:19.584
Yes.

193
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.342
Hello.

194
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:40.897
Who.

195
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:43.608
Are.

196
00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:46.444
You.

197
00:24:47.654 --> 00:24:49.906
Who are you?

198
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.887
I am Larry.

199
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:20.687
Your parents
want you to be normal.

200
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:25.859
I just want to
be your friend.

201
00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:33.825
Hi, honey.

202
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.914
So, I just had
a little chat
with Jennifer.

203
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:43.210
You know how Dr. Robyn
is always talking about
you making friends.

204
00:25:43.293 --> 00:25:45.670
Well, we're gonna
have a sleepover
this weekend.

205
00:25:46.338 --> 00:25:48.548
I know, it's scary.
I'm nervous, too.

206
00:25:48.632 --> 00:25:53.637
I haven't really seen Jennifer
since that whole incident.

207
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.306
But can you try
and have some fun for me?

208
00:26:01.478 --> 00:26:04.773
You noticed your dad's gone
earlier than usual, huh?

209
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:08.318
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

210
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:11.488
I've been wanting
to talk to you about it
for a while,

211
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:13.156
but I just haven't been

212
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.033
sure what to say.

213
00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:17.452
Your dad and I
love you so much.

214
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:19.579
I don't want you
to feel alone.

215
00:26:19.663 --> 00:26:22.624
That's why you're gonna
have a sleepover this weekend.

216
00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:47.190
Is that your way of saying
you don't want to
talk to me about it?

217
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:13.800
Hi.
Hi.

218
00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:16.094
How are you?
Thank you for coming.

219
00:27:16.177 --> 00:27:17.595
Nice to see you.
You, too.

220
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:20.473
So, I hope you're gonna be
okay with these guys.

221
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.435
They can be
a little bit of a handful.

222
00:27:23.518 --> 00:27:24.686
Oh.

223
00:27:24.853 --> 00:27:26.479
Yeah, I think
we'll be fine.

224
00:27:26.563 --> 00:27:28.898
Byron just felt more
comfortable with his posse.

225
00:27:29.733 --> 00:27:32.277
You're welcome
to stay for a while.

226
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.029
Mmm. And spend more time
with Byron than I have to?

227
00:27:34.112 --> 00:27:35.780
- Mom?
- Yes?

228
00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:37.365
I'm just kidding, honey.

229
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:39.909
Not kidding.

230
00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:43.997
So, um,
can I say hi?

231
00:27:44.873 --> 00:27:46.916
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yes. Yeah.

232
00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:53.256
Oliver, you remember
Jennifer, right?

233
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.758
Hi, Oliver.

234
00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:58.428
Why does he do that
weird thing with his fingers?

235
00:27:58.511 --> 00:28:00.180
- Hey, be nice, guys.
- No, it's okay.

236
00:28:00.305 --> 00:28:03.016
Um, it helps
calm him down.

237
00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:04.309
It's called stimming.

238
00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:06.353
Okay. But why?

239
00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:09.939
Well, he's undersensitive
to stimulation,

240
00:28:10.023 --> 00:28:13.318
so sometimes he needs
to touch his own skin
or spin in a circle,

241
00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:14.861
and it makes him feel good.

242
00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:17.614
Can he spin forever
without puking?

243
00:28:17.697 --> 00:28:18.990
Sure seems like it.

244
00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:21.659
That's kind of cool.

245
00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:23.286
Come on, Oliver.

246
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.413
Hi, Oliver.

247
00:28:25.497 --> 00:28:27.207
It's really nice
to see you, honey.

248
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:28.750
My gosh,
you've gotten big.

249
00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:31.169
Yeah. Yeah,
he's still not talking,

250
00:28:31.252 --> 00:28:34.214
but his writing
has really improved.

251
00:28:34.297 --> 00:28:35.840
- That's awesome.
- Mmm-hmm.

252
00:28:36.674 --> 00:28:37.884
High five?

253
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.223
Whoa!

254
00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:46.142
Still strong.
Okay, that is not
gonna happen,

255
00:28:46.226 --> 00:28:49.437
because he knows now
to keep his hands to himself.

256
00:28:49.521 --> 00:28:50.730
- Of course.
- Right, Oliver?

257
00:28:51.356 --> 00:28:54.484
Well,
the boys have all
agreed to include Oliver,

258
00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:57.028
so I'm sure it's just gonna
be a really great night.

259
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:23.054
Is he gonna make
those sounds the whole night?

260
00:29:23.138 --> 00:29:24.806
Keep it down.

261
00:29:34.065 --> 00:29:36.276
Isn't it sad
that your mom
has to force kids

262
00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.361
to come over and pretend
to be your friend?

263
00:29:38.445 --> 00:29:40.280
What are you staring
at anyway?

264
00:29:40.363 --> 00:29:43.199
Moaner Boner has been looking
at that closet all night.

265
00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:45.869
Maybe that's where he keeps
his secret candy stash.

266
00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:51.082
What, you guys are telling me
you don't have
a secret candy stash?

267
00:29:51.249 --> 00:29:53.293
I'm gonna
check it out.

268
00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:03.720
Do you see
any candy?

269
00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:25.116
- Hey, what's your deal?
- We all got these.

270
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.160
Aw, does he think
we're gonna steal it?

271
00:30:27.285 --> 00:30:29.412
Want to see
what kind of games
you got on here.

272
00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:32.207
What's this?

273
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.459
Does your mommy
still read you
bedtime stories?

274
00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:40.340
"This is Larry."

275
00:30:41.382 --> 00:30:43.468
- Who's Larry?
- Yeah. Who's Larry?

276
00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:47.388
This guy.
Whoa. Look at that dude.

277
00:30:47.472 --> 00:30:50.308
Yeah, it looks
just like your dad.
Shut up.

278
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.310
My dad is way hairier.

279
00:30:54.854 --> 00:30:57.106
"Larry never gets
to play pretend.

280
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.692
"He gets made fun of
because he's different."

281
00:31:01.486 --> 00:31:04.280
Okay. Did your parents forget
to pay the electricity bill?

282
00:31:08.076 --> 00:31:09.369
"Larry just wants a friend."

283
00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:14.082
Are you guys seriously
afraid of a dead light bulb?

284
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.670
Two dead light bulbs.

285
00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:35.270
"He's tall
and pale and thin

286
00:31:35.353 --> 00:31:37.355
"and tries to hide his face.

287
00:31:38.815 --> 00:31:40.900
"He isn't from the world
you know.

288
00:31:43.653 --> 00:31:45.863
"Larry comes from
another place."

289
00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:48.783
Maybe we should
stop reading.

290
00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:57.333
"Larry watches
through your windows

291
00:31:57.417 --> 00:31:59.669
"which connect his realm
to yours.

292
00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:04.882
"He need you to know
his whole story to turn
those windows into doors."

293
00:32:05.508 --> 00:32:06.593
What does that mean?

294
00:32:09.804 --> 00:32:12.432
Oh, my God!

295
00:32:14.267 --> 00:32:16.102
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

296
00:32:27.905 --> 00:32:28.906
Oh, no.

297
00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:54.807
Are you
making those sounds,
Moaner Boner?

298
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.118
What the shit is that?

299
00:33:56.369 --> 00:33:59.288
Shit. Shit,
shit, shit.

300
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.547
What the hell
kind of app is this?

301
00:34:07.797 --> 00:34:08.840
Is it an app?

302
00:34:08.923 --> 00:34:09.966
Should I read
the next page?

303
00:34:10.049 --> 00:34:13.344
I'm gonna read the next page.
No, no, no. Don't read
the next page.

304
00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.432
"Larry has looked
through the glass
and found you staring back.

305
00:34:17.974 --> 00:34:19.517
"He understands
your loneliness.

306
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.644
"A true friend
is what you lack.

307
00:34:24.522 --> 00:34:25.815
"Will you be Larry's friend?"

308
00:34:26.357 --> 00:34:29.652
No, no, I will
not be Larry's friend.

309
00:34:29.736 --> 00:34:32.613
Um, guys, guys.
There's nothing
in the corner.

310
00:34:33.698 --> 00:34:37.160
No, no, no.
Don't. Don't.

311
00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:44.250
See?

312
00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:49.589
It's probably
just a fuse.

313
00:34:50.757 --> 00:34:53.301
Do you see him?
Do you see Larry?

314
00:34:53.634 --> 00:34:55.762
Guys, there's
no such thing as Larry.

315
00:34:55.845 --> 00:34:58.181
It's just your imagination
playing tricks on you.

316
00:35:07.315 --> 00:35:10.568
What is happening?
Oh! My God.

317
00:35:11.027 --> 00:35:12.361
Byron, are you okay?

318
00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:22.371
I don't know how
this happened.

319
00:35:22.455 --> 00:35:24.499
I don't see how Oliver
could have done this.

320
00:35:24.832 --> 00:35:29.587
Byron? Baby, do you think
you can tell us
what happened?

321
00:35:30.671 --> 00:35:31.672
Who did this?

322
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:36.177
It was...
It was Oliver.

323
00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:38.805
He's a freak.

324
00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:41.182
Excuse me?

325
00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:42.475
Let's go.

326
00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:47.104
Jennifer, I...
I'm sorry.

327
00:35:47.188 --> 00:35:48.439
I am so sorry.

328
00:35:49.774 --> 00:35:51.275
We gotta go.

329
00:36:09.377 --> 00:36:11.879
How did you blow out
all of these lights?

330
00:36:13.673 --> 00:36:16.551
I don't understand.
Were you trying
to hurt Byron again?

331
00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:21.681
Not you?

332
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:23.558
Well, who else
could it have been?

333
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:26.435
You know, if you want friends,
you can't push furniture
into them.

334
00:36:27.812 --> 00:36:29.939
Will you at least help me
move this table?

335
00:36:30.773 --> 00:36:31.774
Please stop humming.

336
00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.609
We are not happy
right now. This...

337
00:36:35.987 --> 00:36:38.155
Is that the SpongeBob song?

338
00:36:57.675 --> 00:36:58.718
You don't...

339
00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.636
You don't have to stop.

340
00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:04.599
Does that help
you calm down?

341
00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:09.312
Maybe I pushed you
into this too fast.

342
00:37:11.314 --> 00:37:12.899
We've got a lot
going on in this house.

343
00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:15.276
And maybe we're just
not ready for friends.

344
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:28.998
Let's fly on over
to the Midwestern region.

345
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:32.209
Which one is this,
North or South Dakota?

346
00:37:32.835 --> 00:37:34.462
- South.
- That's right.

347
00:37:35.713 --> 00:37:40.259
- Underneath South Dakota is?
- Nebraska?

348
00:37:40.343 --> 00:37:41.427
Nebraska.

349
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:44.138
Jake, what's under Nebraska?

350
00:37:44.472 --> 00:37:46.891
- Kansas.
- Kansas. Nice one.

351
00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:50.269
Oliver, you want
to give this one a try?

352
00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:53.189
Oliver, did you bring
your talker today?

353
00:37:56.525 --> 00:37:58.027
Another day.

354
00:37:59.779 --> 00:38:01.113
And under Kansas...

355
00:38:01.906 --> 00:38:03.115
Oklahoma?

356
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.152
"Misunderstood Monsters.

357
00:39:21.694 --> 00:39:23.279
"This is Larry.

358
00:39:25.364 --> 00:39:28.075
"Larry never gets
to play pretend.

359
00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:30.828
"He gets made fun of
because he is different.

360
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.205
"Larry just wants a friend."

361
00:39:53.809 --> 00:39:55.102
Ugh.

362
00:39:58.272 --> 00:39:59.440
Ugh.

363
00:40:01.776 --> 00:40:02.777
Ugh.

364
00:40:22.713 --> 00:40:24.090
Marty?

365
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:37.478
Hello?

366
00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:27.820
Hello?

367
00:41:30.823 --> 00:41:31.824
Hello.

368
00:41:41.709 --> 00:41:43.419
"Somebody watching me."

369
00:41:44.336 --> 00:41:46.797
Oliver, what the hell
did you download
on this thing?

370
00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:50.134
Say goodbye to Oliver.

371
00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:52.761
Have you been
talking to my son?

372
00:41:53.137 --> 00:41:55.848
You need to stop.
This is not funny.

373
00:42:03.063 --> 00:42:05.816
Stay away from my son.
I won't let you hurt him.

374
00:42:07.985 --> 00:42:09.195
Not hurt.

375
00:42:12.198 --> 00:42:14.033
Take.

376
00:42:14.158 --> 00:42:17.578
Take, take, take, take, take.

377
00:42:29.256 --> 00:42:30.424
Why?

378
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:34.386
To collect and...
Everything okay?

379
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.888
Sorry. Yeah.
Oliver?

380
00:42:36.305 --> 00:42:37.640
- Is Oliver here?
- Yeah.

381
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:40.142
Thank God
you're all right.

382
00:42:40.226 --> 00:42:41.727
We gotta go.

383
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:46.148
We have a family emergency,
so we're just gonna go.

384
00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:52.780
Just gotta get
you home, okay?

385
00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:55.950
I know, I know.
This isn't part
of your routine.

386
00:42:56.575 --> 00:42:57.743
It's just...

387
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.997
Someone was
watching us at home.

388
00:43:02.957 --> 00:43:05.042
They said they
want to take you.

389
00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:06.377
Oh.

390
00:43:09.838 --> 00:43:11.715
Hi. Jen, I can't...

391
00:43:13.676 --> 00:43:15.594
What do you mean,
he's not talking?

392
00:43:17.513 --> 00:43:20.224
I don't know what
they got up to this weekend,

393
00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:22.977
but Byron,
he still hasn't slept.

394
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.729
Didn't go to school,
won't eat.

395
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:29.650
Two days of him
not talking and...

396
00:43:29.733 --> 00:43:31.902
I seriously don't know
how you do it.

397
00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:35.531
I think someone hacked
into Oliver's screen.

398
00:43:36.615 --> 00:43:38.075
Someone was talking to him...

399
00:43:47.584 --> 00:43:52.006
SpongeBob, I just want to say
that I'm sorr...

400
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:54.091
What?

401
00:43:54.174 --> 00:43:57.136
I'm trying to say I'm...

402
00:43:59.388 --> 00:44:00.806
What?

403
00:44:01.223 --> 00:44:03.100
How could someone
use that to get to...

404
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.107
Honey, it's nice of you
to try and apologize,

405
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.860
but I don't think he wants to
watch SpongeBob right now.

406
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.111
It was Larry.

407
00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:16.822
Honey?

408
00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:20.534
Oliver didn't
do anything.

409
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:23.162
- It was Larry.
- Who's Larry?

410
00:44:23.287 --> 00:44:27.583
I read about Larry today
in that story.

411
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.460
Tell me what you saw.
Please.

412
00:44:30.711 --> 00:44:34.798
Larry just wants a friend.
He... He made
the lights go out.

413
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.761
I... I could hear him
in the house.

414
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.846
He moved things.

415
00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:44.224
But I couldn't see him.

416
00:44:45.476 --> 00:44:46.518
Not really.

417
00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:49.438
So, you guys
played make-believe?

418
00:44:49.938 --> 00:44:50.939
No.

419
00:44:53.192 --> 00:44:56.111
He's the one that hurt me.
Not Oliver.

420
00:44:56.779 --> 00:44:57.946
Larry.

421
00:44:58.489 --> 00:45:00.115
I could feel him.

422
00:45:01.075 --> 00:45:02.910
His hands around my neck.

423
00:45:07.915 --> 00:45:09.708
He tried to kill me.

424
00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:14.588
Larry just wants a friend.

425
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:19.093
Larry just wants a friend.
Larry just wants a friend.

426
00:45:20.344 --> 00:45:22.679
Larry just wants a friend.

427
00:45:27.059 --> 00:45:30.604
Hurry, Oliver.
We gotta get to Dad's.
We can't stay here.

428
00:45:34.108 --> 00:45:38.278
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing,
but better to be safe, right?

429
00:45:38.362 --> 00:45:39.738
Can you look at me?

430
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:45.244
We should get going. Okay?

431
00:45:47.162 --> 00:45:48.664
And no screens.

432
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:51.578
Oliver?

433
00:48:26.363 --> 00:48:30.742
- What are you talking about?
- I know it sounds crazy.

434
00:48:30.826 --> 00:48:34.746
But I was reading
this story about Larry,
and then the lights,

435
00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.499
they started
going on and off.

436
00:48:37.916 --> 00:48:40.252
And then another one

437
00:48:40.335 --> 00:48:41.878
is going on and off.

438
00:48:43.088 --> 00:48:47.050
It was like he was using
the electricity to move
around the room.

439
00:48:47.718 --> 00:48:50.596
And then, he screwed in
all the new light bulbs.

440
00:48:50.721 --> 00:48:52.431
So, he helped you
with your chores.

441
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.895
He must have needed the power
or something to come alive.

442
00:48:59.396 --> 00:49:00.689
Larry?
Larry.

443
00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:04.484
I knew I shouldn't
have moved out.

444
00:49:05.736 --> 00:49:09.489
I am not making this up.
Oliver saw him.

445
00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:14.328
There is something
inside our house.

446
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.207
Oliver, here.
Tell Daddy.

447
00:49:23.378 --> 00:49:29.384
He wants me as friend.

448
00:49:29.468 --> 00:49:31.762
This thing
wants our son.

449
00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:33.930
Okay.

450
00:49:34.056 --> 00:49:36.600
I think you need
a good night's sleep.

451
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:38.769
I'll take him to school
in the morning.

452
00:49:38.894 --> 00:49:41.271
No, I am not letting him
out of our sight.

453
00:49:41.355 --> 00:49:43.148
How do we know
the school is safe?

454
00:49:43.231 --> 00:49:45.567
Okay. Well, why don't
I bring him to
work with me tonight,

455
00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:47.277
if he's not going
to school tomorrow?

456
00:49:47.361 --> 00:49:48.612
Absolutely not.

457
00:49:48.695 --> 00:49:50.322
Come on. What,
you don't trust me
with him?

458
00:49:50.489 --> 00:49:52.115
No, it's not that.
It's...

459
00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:55.786
Rest is important
for the body.

460
00:49:56.286 --> 00:50:00.540
So you sleep
and we can talk about
all this tomorrow.

461
00:50:02.376 --> 00:50:06.630
Really, come on.
Let me take care of him.

462
00:50:13.053 --> 00:50:15.806
Give this and the change
to the gentleman.

463
00:50:17.432 --> 00:50:18.642
There you go.

464
00:50:19.101 --> 00:50:21.353
Thanks so much.
Have a good one.

465
00:50:23.063 --> 00:50:24.856
My man is a pro!

466
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.527
Very nicely done.

467
00:50:29.152 --> 00:50:31.154
See? Look how good
you are at that!

468
00:50:31.238 --> 00:50:33.365
You could take over
for me some nights.

469
00:50:33.448 --> 00:50:36.034
The best part is that
in between cars, you can
do whatever you want.

470
00:50:36.118 --> 00:50:39.830
You can listen to the radio.
You can even watch SpongeBob.

471
00:50:48.088 --> 00:50:49.297
Oh, hey.

472
00:50:50.424 --> 00:50:54.177
Is this the infamous
haunted screen?

473
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:55.679
It's okay.

474
00:50:55.762 --> 00:50:58.265
Hey, do you know how
your nightmares aren't real?

475
00:50:58.348 --> 00:51:01.810
Well, neither are
ghosts or ghouls
or vampires or witches.

476
00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:03.395
And certainly not Larrys.

477
00:51:04.813 --> 00:51:06.231
"This is Larry.

478
00:51:06.523 --> 00:51:08.108
"He's..."

479
00:51:40.724 --> 00:51:42.559
"Will you
be Larry's friend?"

480
00:52:03.371 --> 00:52:05.582
It's nothing.

481
00:52:05.749 --> 00:52:06.792
Happens all the time.

482
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.251
It's okay.

483
00:52:10.504 --> 00:52:11.505
Huh.

484
00:52:14.758 --> 00:52:15.759
Hang tight.

485
00:52:30.982 --> 00:52:32.359
All right.

486
00:52:35.445 --> 00:52:38.406
Let's see
what we have here.

487
00:55:16.398 --> 00:55:18.316
Oliver, what are
you doing, buddy?

488
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:20.944
What if a car
drove in, huh?

489
00:55:21.027 --> 00:55:22.404
You gotta
be more careful.

490
00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.453
Hey. Here, give me this.

491
00:55:30.787 --> 00:55:32.080
Look, hey.

492
00:55:32.664 --> 00:55:33.707
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

493
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:35.959
Look, buddy,
there is nothing.

494
00:55:36.084 --> 00:55:37.502
Hey, look at me.

495
00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:40.797
I mean, there's nothing out
there, okay?

496
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.090
I'll show you. Look.

497
00:55:45.635 --> 00:55:46.636
See?

498
00:55:47.262 --> 00:55:48.263
Look at that.

499
00:55:57.564 --> 00:55:58.565
See?

500
00:55:59.816 --> 00:56:00.900
You're totally safe.

501
00:56:12.328 --> 00:56:13.955
Oliver.

502
00:56:14.039 --> 00:56:15.081
Let him go!

503
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.681
Okay.

504
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.641
Okay.

505
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:36.436
Okay.

506
00:56:36.519 --> 00:56:39.314
I saw through that...
That... That screen.

507
00:56:40.106 --> 00:56:41.816
The way he
was holding Oliver...

508
00:56:42.484 --> 00:56:44.152
Why does
he want our son?

509
00:56:44.235 --> 00:56:47.197
The story said
something, um, about, um...

510
00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.948
A true friend
is what you lack.

511
00:56:49.491 --> 00:56:50.909
He hasn't had
a friend since...

512
00:56:50.992 --> 00:56:52.202
Since...

513
00:56:52.869 --> 00:56:55.497
Oh, yeah,
since Jennifer and I
got in our fight, I know.

514
00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.581
Stupid fight.

515
00:56:56.664 --> 00:57:01.086
Hey, Oliver hit Byron,
and then she decided
our son was dangerous.

516
00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:05.340
Either way,
he's been lonely
long before that.

517
00:57:05.423 --> 00:57:08.218
I mean, Oliver's
been staring at his screens
for years, and that...

518
00:57:08.635 --> 00:57:10.887
That thing has been staring
right back.

519
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:12.806
And how come
we can't see it, huh?

520
00:57:12.889 --> 00:57:13.932
I don't know.

521
00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:15.058
It doesn't
make any sense.

522
00:57:15.141 --> 00:57:17.977
How can he be here
and not here
at the same time?

523
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:21.940
What have you got, honey?

524
00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:24.734
That's very nice.

525
00:57:43.461 --> 00:57:44.712
We got some kid.

526
00:57:45.255 --> 00:57:47.590
Larry's in his world,
and we're in ours, but...

527
00:57:47.674 --> 00:57:48.925
But we're also together.

528
00:57:50.385 --> 00:57:53.763
Larry can interact with us,
but he can't reach us.

529
00:57:53.847 --> 00:57:55.557
He can't get to Oliver yet.

530
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:57.809
That's why he wants
to get into our world.

531
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.061
If that's his window...

532
00:58:01.521 --> 00:58:04.023
Then we have to destroy it
before it becomes his door.

533
00:58:39.559 --> 00:58:41.394
We have a cookie,
we have a blue car,

534
00:58:41.477 --> 00:58:43.563
and you get to choose.
Whichever one you want.

535
00:58:45.023 --> 00:58:46.274
What's it gonna be?

536
00:58:46.816 --> 00:58:48.151
Yeah, good!

537
00:58:48.234 --> 00:58:50.445
Marty and I
both experienced it.

538
00:58:50.528 --> 00:58:52.822
It's not just
in Oliver's imagination.

539
00:58:52.906 --> 00:58:54.240
I'll be right back,
kiddo.

540
00:58:58.036 --> 00:59:02.624
Sarah, do you know
what a physical empath is?

541
00:59:03.208 --> 00:59:04.250
No.

542
00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:07.712
It's when you
love someone so much

543
00:59:07.795 --> 00:59:10.340
that you feel
or experience their pain.

544
00:59:10.423 --> 00:59:11.841
It's a good sign.

545
00:59:11.925 --> 00:59:13.885
It shows just how much
you care about Oliver.

546
00:59:13.968 --> 00:59:15.720
And it's very common
in parents.

547
00:59:16.512 --> 00:59:18.181
So you're saying

548
00:59:18.264 --> 00:59:21.309
that we could be
seeing his imagination
because we love him?

549
00:59:21.392 --> 00:59:22.852
That doesn't
make any sense.

550
00:59:23.436 --> 00:59:26.272
But an invisible monster
that travels through
electricity does?

551
00:59:29.067 --> 00:59:30.902
Well, we're hoping that
that's over now

552
00:59:30.985 --> 00:59:32.278
because we destroyed
that thing.

553
00:59:32.362 --> 00:59:35.657
So does he have a way
to communicate?

554
00:59:37.033 --> 00:59:40.245
I'll let him take
my phone with him
to school

555
00:59:40.328 --> 00:59:41.871
until we can afford
a new one.

556
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.499
Unless you could
get him talking first.

557
00:59:44.582 --> 00:59:46.084
Sarah.

558
00:59:46.542 --> 00:59:50.755
Come on. It's...
It's extremely rare
for kids his age

559
00:59:50.838 --> 00:59:53.800
to start verbalizing
in the way
I fear you're imagining.

560
00:59:53.883 --> 00:59:56.261
I know, I know.

561
00:59:56.552 --> 00:59:57.553
I just...

562
00:59:58.513 --> 01:00:02.100
I just want to make sure
that you still have
the right expectations.

563
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:06.896
If he can say a few words,
maybe a sentence
here or there,

564
01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.356
that would be a big win.

565
01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:12.026
We have to keep
remembering his strengths.

566
01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:19.742
Have you seen him again?

567
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.671
What's this?

568
01:00:33.298 --> 01:00:38.219
He gave it to me.

569
01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:40.471
Seriously?

570
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.141
Yes.

571
01:00:43.725 --> 01:00:47.687
Then Mom and Dad
broke him.

572
01:00:48.313 --> 01:00:49.314
Broke him?

573
01:00:50.315 --> 01:00:51.691
So, like,
he's gone, then?

574
01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:54.235
Yes.

575
01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.044
Can I ask you something?

576
01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.087
Yes.

577
01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:15.715
Why'd you stop
being my friend?

578
01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:19.844
We used to hang out
all the time.

579
01:01:22.764 --> 01:01:26.976
I did bad thing.

580
01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:28.102
You did?

581
01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:30.772
Punch face.

582
01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:34.025
Your mom mad.

583
01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:36.027
I barely
even had a bruise.

584
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.614
The next day, I was
asking my mom when we could
have another sleepover,

585
01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:42.533
but she played me
a message
from your mom.

586
01:01:43.451 --> 01:01:45.620
Your mom said
you didn't want to be
my friend anymore.

587
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.459
That is lie.

588
01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:55.171
Wait, so you
never said that?

589
01:01:56.339 --> 01:01:57.340
Lie.

590
01:01:58.716 --> 01:01:59.717
Wrong.

591
01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:02.595
I never.

592
01:02:05.014 --> 01:02:06.015
Lie.

593
01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.436
Moms are so weird.

594
01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:13.106
What are you watching
over there?

595
01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.733
Wait, let me guess.

596
01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:17.443
SpongeBob?

597
01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:50.810
No.

598
01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:20.650
No!

599
01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:24.195
Help!

600
01:04:24.946 --> 01:04:27.490
Hello? Somebody help.

601
01:04:32.745 --> 01:04:33.788
Oh...

602
01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:00.893
Where are you?

603
01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:05.773
Shoot.

604
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.564
You need any help
with your homework?

605
01:07:51.485 --> 01:07:53.154
Hey, I talked
to Jennifer today.

606
01:07:53.738 --> 01:07:55.489
She said Byron's
doing much better.

607
01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.418
Hello?

608
01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:10.880
How?

609
01:08:10.963 --> 01:08:13.632
We found him in his car
on the side of the road.

610
01:08:13.716 --> 01:08:17.303
We're not sure
how it happened.
He was unresponsive.

611
01:08:17.386 --> 01:08:18.971
We rushed him
to the hospital.

612
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:20.931
Hello?

613
01:08:25.436 --> 01:08:26.437
Hello?

614
01:08:27.563 --> 01:08:28.564
Hello?

615
01:08:29.023 --> 01:08:31.650
Hello.

616
01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:52.463
Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
How may I help you?

617
01:08:53.297 --> 01:08:54.590
Did you turn it on?

618
01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:56.634
...jumbo Krabby Patty.

619
01:08:56.967 --> 01:08:58.052
Hey, what's that?

620
01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:01.764
What are you doing
behind the counter?

621
01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:11.232
He.

622
01:09:11.315 --> 01:09:12.399
Will.

623
01:09:12.483 --> 01:09:13.484
Follow.

624
01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:14.568
You.

625
01:09:14.652 --> 01:09:15.653
Until.

626
01:09:15.736 --> 01:09:16.987
You.
Finish.

627
01:09:17.071 --> 01:09:18.072
That.

628
01:09:18.155 --> 01:09:19.156
Story.

629
01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.118
Why are you
doing this to us?

630
01:09:25.454 --> 01:09:26.705
Where did you
come from?

631
01:09:32.378 --> 01:09:33.462
World.

632
01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:34.547
Only.

633
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:35.965
Look.
At.

634
01:09:36.048 --> 01:09:37.049
Screens.

635
01:09:37.132 --> 01:09:38.717
Not.
Each other.

636
01:09:41.554 --> 01:09:42.555
What does that mean?

637
01:09:43.973 --> 01:09:44.974
People.

638
01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.475
Very.
Lonely.

639
01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:48.143
All.

640
01:09:48.227 --> 01:09:49.937
That.
Loneliness.

641
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.605
In.
World.

642
01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:52.731
Made.

643
01:09:52.815 --> 01:09:54.149
Larry.

644
01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.401
Larry.

645
01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:57.194
Made.
Of.

646
01:09:57.278 --> 01:09:58.612
Loneliness.

647
01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:01.699
Larry is lonely.

648
01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:07.162
How do you think
I would feel
if Larry took Oliver?

649
01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:13.836
Finish.
The.

650
01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:14.920
Story.

651
01:10:15.004 --> 01:10:16.297
Finish.

652
01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.048
The.
Story.

653
01:10:18.132 --> 01:10:19.133
No.

654
01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:27.266
No, no, no, no.

655
01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:40.487
No, stop. Stop.

656
01:11:00.925 --> 01:11:02.885
No. No! No.

657
01:11:55.604 --> 01:11:58.440
Can you just be normal
for one second?

658
01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:06.407
Oliver?

659
01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:08.200
Oliver, I didn't mean it.

660
01:12:11.787 --> 01:12:12.788
Honey.

661
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:20.295
Sometimes
even moms and dads say things
that they shouldn't.

662
01:12:22.756 --> 01:12:23.757
I just... I...

663
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.845
Your dad...

664
01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:31.223
He's been in an accident.

665
01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:33.684
And, um...

666
01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:35.352
They're trying
to wake him up.

667
01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:40.858
Something happened to him,
and I think it was Larry.

668
01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:44.737
And I cannot
let Larry get us, too.

669
01:13:13.057 --> 01:13:14.058
Oh, my God.

670
01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:06.318
Run! Let's go!

671
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.685
Okay,
we're gonna go
for the door.

672
01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:23.729
Stay quiet.

673
01:15:49.254 --> 01:15:50.255
Oliver,

674
01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:53.217
if something happens to us,

675
01:15:55.886 --> 01:15:57.387
I don't want you think

676
01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:00.057
that I meant what I said
downstairs.

677
01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:10.651
What did I lie about?

678
01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:13.695
"Byron"?

679
01:16:15.364 --> 01:16:16.365
Oh, honey, I...

680
01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:18.283
You hit him
out of nowhere,

681
01:16:18.367 --> 01:16:21.954
and I thought it would be
easier for everyone
if I just cut ties.

682
01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.208
"You took away..."

683
01:16:29.086 --> 01:16:30.087
"Friend."

684
01:16:31.046 --> 01:16:34.925
"Now I go with..."

685
01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:40.847
No, no, no.
Don't go with Larry.

686
01:16:41.056 --> 01:16:43.183
You were right.
I did lie.

687
01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.060
And I didn't do it...

688
01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.230
Honey, I didn't do it
to protect you.

689
01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:50.941
I did it to protect me.

690
01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:54.319
Oliver.

691
01:16:55.237 --> 01:16:57.197
Can you look at me, please?

692
01:16:58.282 --> 01:16:59.908
Please, can you look at me?

693
01:17:02.953 --> 01:17:04.204
It's okay.

694
01:17:04.288 --> 01:17:05.831
I know you're listening.

695
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.417
You're always listening.

696
01:17:12.796 --> 01:17:14.464
Much more
than I listen to you.

697
01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:32.357
Oliver.

698
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:44.911
Oliver.

699
01:18:25.202 --> 01:18:28.205
Oliver.

700
01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:44.054
Come play.

701
01:19:18.505 --> 01:19:20.966
Friend.

702
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.598
Friend!

703
01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:41.236
F...

704
01:19:42.362 --> 01:19:43.822
F...

705
01:19:43.905 --> 01:19:45.782
Shh.

706
01:19:50.996 --> 01:19:52.581
F...
Shh.

707
01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:55.292
Field.

708
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:59.212
Field, field, field, field.

709
01:19:59.296 --> 01:20:01.047
Field, field, field, field.

710
01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:09.181
No! No!

711
01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:13.226
Oliver!

712
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:28.158
Field, field, field,
field, field, field.

713
01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:29.534
Why the field?

714
01:21:38.395 --> 01:21:39.980
There's
no electricity here.

715
01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:41.898
He can't get us.

716
01:21:58.873 --> 01:22:01.334
Oh, you did it.
You did it.

717
01:22:01.418 --> 01:22:02.586
You saved us.

718
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:03.670
Oh!

719
01:22:32.574 --> 01:22:33.575
Run!

720
01:22:34.117 --> 01:22:36.244
Run! Come on! Run!

721
01:23:01.269 --> 01:23:03.438
Stop. No, Oliver.

722
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.031
Oliver!

723
01:23:19.663 --> 01:23:20.830
No!

724
01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:25.710
Oliver!

725
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:21.224
Friends?

726
01:25:14.903 --> 01:25:16.196
I'll be your friend, Larry.

727
01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:20.867
We both want the same thing.

728
01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:24.037
We both want
to protect Oliver.

729
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.765
I love you.

730
01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:47.477
I love all of you.

731
01:27:31.122 --> 01:27:32.123
Good.

732
01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:34.334
Now you want
to give it a try?

733
01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:40.006
"Mom."

734
01:27:40.924 --> 01:27:42.592
"Mom." Excellent.

735
01:27:43.635 --> 01:27:48.014
"Loves

736
01:27:49.557 --> 01:27:53.019
"me."

737
01:27:54.062 --> 01:27:57.190
Wonderful. "Mom loves me."

738
01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:59.901
I know for a fact your mom
loves you very much.

739
01:28:01.736 --> 01:28:02.904
You're so good with him.

740
01:28:03.947 --> 01:28:04.948
So are you.

741
01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:07.450
How's he doing
at home?

742
01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:09.535
Uh...

743
01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:10.787
He seems okay.

744
01:28:12.622 --> 01:28:16.417
I've been trying to give him
more social experiences,
like you said.

745
01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:20.672
And we've been
practicing his speech,
like, five times a day.

746
01:28:21.214 --> 01:28:23.299
Well, you don't want
to wear him out.

747
01:28:23.383 --> 01:28:24.968
I'd say three times a day.

748
01:28:25.093 --> 01:28:26.719
Oh, okay.

749
01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:29.347
Got it.

750
01:28:33.101 --> 01:28:34.727
"Three times a day.

751
01:28:36.396 --> 01:28:38.356
"For speech work."

752
01:28:45.488 --> 01:28:47.281
Well, you know, Sarah,
she was...

753
01:28:50.493 --> 01:28:51.494
Incredible.

754
01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:57.625
I thought I understood,
but I...

755
01:29:05.675 --> 01:29:07.260
I just wish
I could tell her

756
01:29:08.469 --> 01:29:09.554
that I'm sorry.

757
01:29:12.932 --> 01:29:14.267
That I'm trying now.

758
01:29:16.602 --> 01:29:18.229
I'm sure
she'd like to hear that.

759
01:29:20.565 --> 01:29:21.566
I hope

760
01:29:22.734 --> 01:29:23.735
they'll find her.

761
01:29:34.829 --> 01:29:35.955
Is that you?

762
01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.381
Hey.

763
01:29:46.257 --> 01:29:47.258
Hey.

764
01:29:49.093 --> 01:29:52.430
Can I, uh,
eat lunch with you guys
tomorrow or something?

765
01:29:53.139 --> 01:29:54.140
That depends.

766
01:29:55.683 --> 01:29:57.393
Are you willing
to take the pledge?

767
01:29:57.935 --> 01:29:58.936
What pledge?

768
01:30:02.523 --> 01:30:03.649
A secret handshake

769
01:30:04.776 --> 01:30:06.486
for those of us
who've seen Larry.

770
01:30:07.570 --> 01:30:08.988
The pledge
to stay friends.

771
01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:12.116
To play together forever,

772
01:30:12.533 --> 01:30:15.244
so no one has to be alone,
like Larry.

773
01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:14.822
I'll protect you.

What is this break?

Like, I-I... I'm here

The water is shimmering.

Good morning to you, sir.

17
00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.902
Would you care to blow a bubble?

18
00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:23.734
Oliver.

19
00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.735
We're okay. We're okay.

20
00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:28.037
What happened? Huh?

21
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:30.140
Can you use your words, please?

22
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:33.943
There you go.

23
00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:40.984
Something.

24
00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:42.919
In.

25
00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:44.121
House.

26
00:07:44.153 --> 00:07:46.255
Something in house.

27
00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:48.125
That was probably
just a nightmare,

28
00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:50.259
'cause there is nobody
in the house

29
00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:52.228
but your mom and your dad.

30
00:07:52.261 --> 00:07:53.830
All right, come here.

31
00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:55.499
Come here, come here, come here.

32
00:07:55.532 --> 00:07:58.435
Can you take some deep breaths
for me, huh?

33
00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:02.306
Okay? We're gonna do
some deep breaths.

34
00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:04.807
Okay?

35
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.291
So, he woke up in the
middle of the night screaming.

36
00:08:21.323 --> 00:08:23.893
I went in there. I was up
for two hours with him.

37
00:08:23.926 --> 00:08:25.763
He's a little boy.

38
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:28.098
- He has nightmares.
- That's easy for you to say.

39
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.032
You never go in with him.
It's always me.

40
00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:31.435
I slept through it.

41
00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:33.503
- All right? I'm sorry.
- No, don't do that.

42
00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:35.939
Why can't you just admit
that you don't want to help?

43
00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:37.975
I help, okay?

44
00:08:38.008 --> 00:08:39.877
I always help... when I'm awake.

45
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.044
Hey, buddy.

46
00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:44.148
No more nightmares, huh?

47
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:46.550
I heard you had
a bad dream, bud.

48
00:08:46.582 --> 00:08:48.951
Need a hug?

49
00:08:48.984 --> 00:08:51.888
I know what the problem is.

50
00:08:53.123 --> 00:08:54.859
Too far away.

51
00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:57.527
Yep. Let's see.

52
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:00.964
Ten feet. Oh, that's definitely
too far for a hug.

53
00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:03.066
What do you think five feet is?

54
00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:04.501
Yeah, okay.

55
00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:06.102
Little closer.

56
00:09:06.135 --> 00:09:08.437
I'm getting the weirdest
reading on this thing.

57
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.806
It just...

58
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.109
Tummy tickles!

59
00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:13.343
Ooh!

60
00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:16.012
Your throne, sire.

61
00:09:19.548 --> 00:09:22.518
Are you able to make it
to his speech therapy today?

62
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:24.153
Oh, sorry, I can't.

63
00:09:24.186 --> 00:09:26.989
Uh, I picked up a shift
at the parking lot.

64
00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:29.192
Oh, well, hopefully,
you can make one soon, right?

65
00:09:30.224 --> 00:09:30.527
Yeah, for sure.

66
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.029
Are.

67
00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:35.965
We.

68
00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:37.334
Moving.

69
00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:40.304
Are we moving?

70
00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:48.412
You are not moving anywhere,
okay?

71
00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:50.281
So don't worry.

72
00:09:52.382 --> 00:09:53.950
Today, we're gonna start in

73
00:09:53.984 --> 00:09:55.619
with multiplying
more than two numbers.

74
00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:57.554
Not cool, man.

75
00:09:57.586 --> 00:10:00.157
You don't even know
what you're groaning about.

76
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.992
It's not so hard.
If you can multiply

77
00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:04.126
two numbers, you can multiply
three. You just take it...

78
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:06.495
Make sure you pay attention
to the lesson, okay?

79
00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:08.231
Anybody want to take this?

80
00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:10.399
Come on, you learn by trying.

81
00:10:10.432 --> 00:10:12.468
Nobody?

82
00:10:12.502 --> 00:10:14.171
Oliver.

83
00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:19.409
What do you make
of these three numbers?

84
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.450
The.

85
00:10:26.483 --> 00:10:27.584
Answer.

86
00:10:27.617 --> 00:10:29.286
Is.

87
00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:31.054
Eight.

88
00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:33.289
The answer is eight.

89
00:10:33.322 --> 00:10:35.524
Not quite. I see
what you did there, though.

90
00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:36.926
You were adding
instead of multiplying.

91
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.262
Very good try, Oliver.

92
00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:40.163
Anyone else
want to give it a go?

93
00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:41.931
Go ahead, Byron.

94
00:10:41.965 --> 00:10:44.468
How come Oliver still gets
to use his phone in class

95
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.335
but you took mine away?

96
00:10:46.369 --> 00:10:48.238
He's autistic, dude.

97
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.107
So he gets special treatment?

98
00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:52.074
Oliver gets to use his phone

99
00:10:52.108 --> 00:10:53.210
because he wasn't playing
Fortnite

100
00:10:53.243 --> 00:10:54.378
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

101
00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:56.046
Ooh.

102
00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:58.614
Let's get back
to our first pair.

103
00:10:58.648 --> 00:11:02.252
The product of two and four...
why don't we start there?

104
00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:03.986
Try one of those

105
00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.055
radioactive sludge balls
you call food?

106
00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:07.324
Next, I suppose you'll want me

107
00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:08.624
to go square-dancing
with Patrick.

108
00:11:08.657 --> 00:11:10.159
Hey. What's up?

109
00:11:10.192 --> 00:11:12.028
Sorry, Patrick.

110
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:14.632
Do you want to come
hang out with us?

111
00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:18.502
Where?

112
00:11:18.534 --> 00:11:20.670
Oh, uh, it's just...

113
00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:22.973
I saw something cool over there.

114
00:11:28.277 --> 00:11:30.113
That way.

115
00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:32.216
I'll catch up in a sec.

116
00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:08.151
Friends.

117
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.560
Hello?

118
00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:27.370
Hey.

119
00:12:27.403 --> 00:12:29.038
I can't believe
he actually fell for it.

120
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:31.207
Of course he did.

121
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.508
- He's such a loser.
- Is he having

122
00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:34.076
- a heart attack?
- He totally is.

123
00:12:34.109 --> 00:12:35.211
We're supposed to call 911.

124
00:12:35.244 --> 00:12:36.312
Dude, dude, listen.

125
00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:38.347
That's just how he talks.

126
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.082
Moaner Boner.

127
00:12:40.115 --> 00:12:42.686
It's like, he can't even talk.

128
00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:51.427
Exactly. Hey, maybe
he's a robot under his skin.

129
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.196
Moaner Boner thinks he's special.

130
00:12:55.764 --> 00:12:58.167
Oh, did you want
to say something?

131
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.469
I can't believe you used to be

132
00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:00.737
friends with
Moaner Boner over here.

133
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:02.371
- My mom made me.
- You.

134
00:13:02.404 --> 00:13:03.739
I didn't want to.

135
00:13:03.773 --> 00:13:06.609
Are.

136
00:13:06.643 --> 00:13:08.077
Very.

137
00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:12.548
You are very ugly.

138
00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:18.721
Who's ugly now?

139
00:13:20.255 --> 00:13:22.258
Come on.

140
00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:45.148
I didn't know
what to think when I pulled up

141
00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:47.551
and he wasn't there
waiting for me.

142
00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:50.387
I went right into
the worst-case scenarios.

143
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.322
Uh, did he get in trouble?

144
00:13:52.354 --> 00:13:54.324
Did someone take him?

145
00:13:55.758 --> 00:13:59.796
And then I found him
just screaming in the field.

146
00:13:59.829 --> 00:14:02.599
That sounds very scary
for both of you.

147
00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:05.268
And he lost his phone somehow.

148
00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:08.405
I wish he could explain
what happened.

149
00:14:08.437 --> 00:14:10.506
Good.

150
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.243
Now we're gonna try
using our words.

151
00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:14.678
"Lost...

152
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.580
in field."

153
00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:19.749
We're gonna work
on your F's, okay?

154
00:14:19.782 --> 00:14:21.484
F's can be tricky.

155
00:14:21.518 --> 00:14:23.353
"Field."

156
00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:26.422
"Field." Can you try that?

157
00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:28.558
F...

158
00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:32.595
F...

159
00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:35.131
F...

160
00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:36.700
Oliver, you can do it.

161
00:14:36.733 --> 00:14:39.536
F...

162
00:14:42.504 --> 00:14:43.672
Okay.

163
00:14:43.705 --> 00:14:46.276
Good practicing.

164
00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:48.344
Have you been
trying to provide him

165
00:14:48.378 --> 00:14:49.912
with social experiences,

166
00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:51.480
like we discussed?

167
00:14:51.513 --> 00:14:53.282
Poor guy still doesn't have
any friends.

168
00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:58.254
You said he was hanging out
with your friend's son?

169
00:14:58.287 --> 00:15:00.257
- Jennifer's son, Byron.
- Yeah.

170
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.226
- Yeah, w-we're not close anymore.
- Okay.

171
00:15:03.258 --> 00:15:06.662
So, if you can make any effort
to help him find friends...

172
00:15:06.696 --> 00:15:09.331
take him to birthday parties,
anything...

173
00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:11.935
it can be a good way
to get him to open up.

174
00:15:11.968 --> 00:15:14.437
And just like he's trying
to get better at talking,

175
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.439
we have to make sure
we're listening.

176
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.380
Okay, Patrick,
it's all in the technique.

177
00:15:23.412 --> 00:15:25.315
First, go like this.

178
00:15:25.348 --> 00:15:26.850
Spin around. Stop.

179
00:15:26.883 --> 00:15:28.718
Double-take three times.

180
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.553
- One, two, three.
- Come on.

181
00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:32.622
Oliver, you got to stay
with me, okay?

182
00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:51.207
Five bucks, please.

183
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.942
Thanks a lot.

184
00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:12.762
Come on.

185
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.479
Oliver, take that box off.

186
00:18:09.512 --> 00:18:10.813
Whoa, buddy.

187
00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:12.982
It's time to brush your teeth.

188
00:18:14.817 --> 00:18:16.019
He's full of energy tonight.

189
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:17.521
Yeah, he is.

190
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:20.590
Where'd you get that?

191
00:18:20.622 --> 00:18:22.926
It was at
the lost and found at work.

192
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.994
I think it just
needs to be charged.

193
00:18:25.026 --> 00:18:27.563
I guess you like it, huh?

194
00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:29.632
Hey, be careful with the screen.

195
00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:31.701
It's a little cracked.

196
00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:32.968
- What?
- You know what.

197
00:18:33.002 --> 00:18:34.738
I run around
with our son all day,

198
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:37.407
and you get to swoop in
and be the hero once again?

199
00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:38.674
The hero?

200
00:18:59.695 --> 00:19:02.432
It's not all presents
and tummy tickles with me

201
00:19:02.465 --> 00:19:04.167
like it is with you.

202
00:19:04.199 --> 00:19:06.535
I just wish I could take
that part of him

203
00:19:06.569 --> 00:19:08.638
and put it in a box
and tape it up

204
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.905
and hide it somewhere

205
00:19:09.938 --> 00:19:12.574
so he didn't have to deal
with it.

206
00:19:12.608 --> 00:19:14.845
Then he wouldn't be our Oliver.

207
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.483
I should've...

208
00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:23.720
I should've taken him sooner.

209
00:19:25.687 --> 00:19:27.924
What if he never learns to talk
because I didn't

210
00:19:27.956 --> 00:19:29.825
- do anything for so long?
- No.

211
00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.595
We didn't do anything.

212
00:19:34.563 --> 00:19:36.999
He's never looked me
in the eyes.

213
00:19:37.032 --> 00:19:39.135
Do you know what it's like
for your own child

214
00:19:39.167 --> 00:19:41.537
to never look you in the eyes?

215
00:19:43.872 --> 00:19:46.074
Well...

216
00:19:46.108 --> 00:19:48.878
he's got nice eyes,
if that helps.

217
00:19:52.048 --> 00:19:54.884
No, Marty, it doesn't help,
because he... he loves you

218
00:19:54.917 --> 00:19:56.119
and he hates me.

219
00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:31.067
Okay, now, how many of you

220
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.202
have played
musical instruments before?

221
00:23:33.234 --> 00:23:35.237
Do instruments of torture count?

222
00:23:35.271 --> 00:23:38.707
- No.
- Is mayonnaise an instrument?

223
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:41.444
No, Patrick, mayonnaise
is not an instrument.

224
00:24:07.403 --> 00:24:08.871
Is.

225
00:24:08.904 --> 00:24:11.107
Dad.

226
00:24:11.139 --> 00:24:12.876
Gone.

227
00:24:14.976 --> 00:24:17.112
Is Dad gone?

228
00:24:18.513 --> 00:24:20.250
Yes.

229
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:27.891
Hello.

230
00:24:40.002 --> 00:24:42.338
Who.

231
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.107
Are.

232
00:24:45.774 --> 00:24:47.877
You.

233
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:50.479
Who are you?

234
00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:12.201
I am Larry.

235
00:25:16.237 --> 00:25:18.840
Your parents want you

236
00:25:18.873 --> 00:25:21.042
to be normal.

237
00:25:21.076 --> 00:25:23.513
I just want

238
00:25:23.545 --> 00:25:26.181
to be your friend.

239
00:25:32.821 --> 00:25:35.257
Hi, honey.

240
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:39.328
So, I just had a little chat
with Jennifer.

241
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.164
You know how Dr. Robyn's always

242
00:25:41.196 --> 00:25:43.198
talking about
you making friends?

243
00:25:43.232 --> 00:25:46.035
Well, we're gonna have
a sleepover this weekend.

244
00:25:46.068 --> 00:25:47.503
I know it's scary.

245
00:25:47.535 --> 00:25:49.337
I'm nervous, too.

246
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.842
I haven't really seen Jennifer
since that whole incident,

247
00:25:53.876 --> 00:25:56.780
but can you try and have
some fun for me?

248
00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:05.888
You noticed your dad's gone
earlier than usual, huh?

249
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.390
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

250
00:26:08.424 --> 00:26:11.093
Um, I've been wanting
to talk to you about it

251
00:26:11.126 --> 00:26:12.862
for a while, but I've just...

252
00:26:12.895 --> 00:26:15.097
I haven't been sure what to say.

253
00:26:15.129 --> 00:26:17.999
Your dad and I love you so much.

254
00:26:18.032 --> 00:26:20.069
I don't want you to feel alone.

255
00:26:20.101 --> 00:26:23.305
That's why we're gonna have
the sleepover this weekend.

256
00:26:44.092 --> 00:26:45.460
Is that your way of saying

257
00:26:45.494 --> 00:26:47.562
you don't want to talk to me
about it?

258
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

259
00:27:14.156 --> 00:27:15.590
- How are you?
- Thank you for coming.

260
00:27:15.623 --> 00:27:17.425
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

261
00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:20.897
So, I hope you're gonna be okay
with these guys.

262
00:27:20.929 --> 00:27:23.666
They can be a little bit
of a handful.

263
00:27:23.698 --> 00:27:25.301
Oh.

264
00:27:25.333 --> 00:27:27.003
Yeah, I think we'll be fine.

265
00:27:27.035 --> 00:27:29.237
Byron just felt more
comfortable with his posse.

266
00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:32.541
- You're welcome to stay for a while.
- Oh.

267
00:27:32.573 --> 00:27:34.342
And spend more time with Byron
than I have to?

268
00:27:34.376 --> 00:27:35.978
- Mom.
- Yes.

269
00:27:36.011 --> 00:27:38.214
I'm just kidding, honey.

270
00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:40.282
Not kidding.

271
00:27:41.282 --> 00:27:44.654
So, um, can I say hi?

272
00:27:44.686 --> 00:27:46.656
Oh, yeah. Of course, yes.

273
00:27:46.688 --> 00:27:48.323
Yeah.

274
00:27:49.725 --> 00:27:51.526
Oliver.

275
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.561
You remember Jennifer, right?

276
00:27:53.594 --> 00:27:55.163
Hi, Oliver.

277
00:27:56.465 --> 00:27:58.667
Why does he do that
weird thing with his fingers?

278
00:27:58.701 --> 00:28:01.070
- Okay, be nice, guys.
- No, it's okay. Um...

279
00:28:01.102 --> 00:28:03.171
It helps calm him down.

280
00:28:03.205 --> 00:28:05.174
- It's called stimming.
- Okay.

281
00:28:05.206 --> 00:28:06.574
But why?

282
00:28:06.608 --> 00:28:09.712
Well, he's under-sensitive
to stimulation,

283
00:28:09.744 --> 00:28:12.180
so sometimes he needs
to touch his own skin

284
00:28:12.214 --> 00:28:15.216
or spin in a circle,
and it makes him feel good.

285
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.520
Can he spin forever
without puking?

286
00:28:17.552 --> 00:28:19.522
Sure seems like it.

287
00:28:19.554 --> 00:28:21.423
That's kind of cool.

288
00:28:21.456 --> 00:28:23.126
Come on, Oliver.

289
00:28:24.193 --> 00:28:25.394
Hi, Oliver.

290
00:28:25.426 --> 00:28:27.495
It's really nice
to see you, honey.

291
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:29.231
My gosh, you've gotten big.

292
00:28:29.263 --> 00:28:31.233
Yeah. Yeah, he's...
he's still not talking,

293
00:28:31.265 --> 00:28:34.003
but his writing
has really improved.

294
00:28:34.035 --> 00:28:37.005
- That's awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.641
High five?

296
00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:44.013
Whoa. Still strong.

297
00:28:44.045 --> 00:28:46.247
Okay, that is not gonna happen,

298
00:28:46.281 --> 00:28:49.417
because he knows now
to keep his hands to himself.

299
00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:51.320
- Of course.
- Right, Oliver?

300
00:28:51.352 --> 00:28:54.489
Well, the boys have
all agreed to include Oliver,

301
00:28:54.523 --> 00:28:57.392
so I'm sure it's just gonna be
a really great night.

302
00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:23.285
Is he gonna make
those sounds the whole night?

303
00:29:23.318 --> 00:29:25.221
Keep it down.

304
00:29:34.128 --> 00:29:36.398
Isn't it sad that your mom
has to force kids

305
00:29:36.432 --> 00:29:38.634
to come over and pretend
to be your friend?

306
00:29:38.667 --> 00:29:40.369
What are you
staring at, anyway?

307
00:29:40.401 --> 00:29:43.238
Moaner Boner's been looking
at that closet all night.

308
00:29:43.272 --> 00:29:46.274
Maybe that's where he keeps
his secret candy stash.

309
00:29:48.276 --> 00:29:49.644
What? Are you guys telling me

310
00:29:49.677 --> 00:29:51.414
you don't have
a secret candy stash?

311
00:29:51.446 --> 00:29:53.349
I'm gonna check it out.

312
00:30:02.491 --> 00:30:04.460
Do you see any candy?

313
00:30:21.176 --> 00:30:22.778
Hey!

314
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:25.080
What's your deal?
We all got these.

315
00:30:25.113 --> 00:30:26.781
Aw, does he think
we're gonna steal it?

316
00:30:26.814 --> 00:30:29.517
Want to see what kind of games
you got on here.

317
00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:32.554
What's this?

318
00:30:32.588 --> 00:30:34.523
Does your mommy still read you
bedtime stories?

319
00:30:39.194 --> 00:30:40.596
"This is Larry."

320
00:30:40.628 --> 00:30:42.465
Who's Larry?

321
00:30:42.497 --> 00:30:44.165
Yeah, who's Larry?

322
00:30:44.198 --> 00:30:45.400
This guy.

323
00:30:45.434 --> 00:30:47.735
Whoa. Look at that dude.

324
00:30:47.769 --> 00:30:49.472
Yeah.
He looks just like your dad.

325
00:30:49.504 --> 00:30:50.738
Shut up.

326
00:30:50.772 --> 00:30:53.208
My dad is way hairier.

327
00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:57.378
"Larry never gets to play pretend.

328
00:30:57.411 --> 00:30:59.547
He gets made fun of
because he's different."

329
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.852
Okay, did your parents
forget to pay

330
00:31:02.885 --> 00:31:04.720
the electricity bill?

331
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:09.825
"Larry just wants a friend."

332
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:14.396
Are you guys seriously
afraid of a dead light bulb?

333
00:31:16.732 --> 00:31:18.701
Two dead light bulbs.

334
00:31:32.481 --> 00:31:35.584
"He's tall and pale and thin

335
00:31:35.617 --> 00:31:37.753
"and tries to hide his face.

336
00:31:39.554 --> 00:31:41.623
"He isn't from
the world you know.

337
00:31:43.859 --> 00:31:46.494
Larry comes from another place."

338
00:31:46.528 --> 00:31:48.764
Uh, maybe we should
stop reading.

339
00:31:55.637 --> 00:31:57.639
"Larry watches
through your windows,

340
00:31:57.673 --> 00:32:00.776
"which connect
his realm to yours.

341
00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:02.744
"He needs you to know
his whole story

342
00:32:02.778 --> 00:32:05.314
to turn those windows
into doors."

343
00:32:05.347 --> 00:32:06.815
What does that mean?

344
00:32:09.584 --> 00:32:10.818
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

345
00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:13.688
Shit! Shit!

346
00:32:13.722 --> 00:32:14.924
Oh, my God.

347
00:32:14.956 --> 00:32:16.457
What's going on?

348
00:32:16.491 --> 00:32:18.194
Oh, my God!

349
00:32:20.529 --> 00:32:23.766
Oh, my God!

350
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:34.275
Come on.

351
00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:55.731
Are you making
those sounds, Moaner Boner?

352
00:33:52.888 --> 00:33:56.324
What the shit is that?

353
00:33:56.358 --> 00:33:57.859
Shit.

354
00:33:57.892 --> 00:33:59.995
Shit, shit, shit.

355
00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:09.338
- What the hell kind of app is this?
- Is it an app?

356
00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:11.507
Should I read the next page?
I'm gonna read the next page.

357
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.442
No, no, no.
Don't read the next page.

358
00:34:14.476 --> 00:34:16.045
"Larry has looked
through the glass

359
00:34:16.078 --> 00:34:17.946
"and found you staring back.

360
00:34:17.978 --> 00:34:19.814
"He understands your loneliness.

361
00:34:19.848 --> 00:34:21.951
"A true friend is what you lack.

362
00:34:24.752 --> 00:34:26.020
Will you be Larry's friend?"

363
00:34:26.054 --> 00:34:29.925
No! No, I will not
be Larry's friend.

364
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:33.095
Guys, guys, th-there's nothing
in the corner.

365
00:34:33.127 --> 00:34:34.696
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No, no, no.

366
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:35.998
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

367
00:34:36.031 --> 00:34:37.632
- Don't! No, don't!
- No, don't! Don't!

368
00:34:42.603 --> 00:34:44.439
See?

369
00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:50.446
It's probably just a fuse.

370
00:34:50.478 --> 00:34:52.348
Do you see him?

371
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.815
Do you see Larry?

372
00:34:53.848 --> 00:34:55.984
Guys, there's
no such thing as Larry.

373
00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:58.587
It's just your imagination
playing tricks on you.

374
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:09.031
What is happening?

375
00:35:09.063 --> 00:35:10.799
Oh, my God!

376
00:35:10.831 --> 00:35:12.868
Byron, are you okay?

377
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.710
I don't know how this happened.

378
00:35:22.743 --> 00:35:24.746
I don't see how Oliver
could've done this.

379
00:35:24.779 --> 00:35:27.715
Byron, baby?

380
00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:30.118
Do you think you can tell us
what happened now?

381
00:35:30.152 --> 00:35:31.686
Who did this?

382
00:35:33.889 --> 00:35:36.825
It was... it was Oliver.

383
00:35:36.857 --> 00:35:39.094
He's a freak.

384
00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:43.065
- Excuse me?
- Let's go.

385
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.503
Jennifer, I... I'm sorry.

386
00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:49.538
I am so sorry.

387
00:35:49.571 --> 00:35:51.906
We got to go.

388
00:36:09.657 --> 00:36:11.893
How did you blow out
all of these lights?

389
00:36:13.494 --> 00:36:14.763
I don't understand.

390
00:36:14.795 --> 00:36:16.831
Were you trying
to hurt Byron again?

391
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.969
Not you?

392
00:36:22.002 --> 00:36:23.871
Well, who else
could it have been?

393
00:36:23.904 --> 00:36:25.173
You know, if you want friends,

394
00:36:25.206 --> 00:36:26.674
you can't push furniture
into them.

395
00:36:28.009 --> 00:36:29.978
Will you at least help me
move this table?

396
00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:31.980
Please stop humming.

397
00:36:32.013 --> 00:36:34.016
We are not happy right now.
This...

398
00:36:35.884 --> 00:36:38.487
Is that the SpongeBob song?

399
00:36:57.739 --> 00:37:01.177
You don't...
you don't have to stop.

400
00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:05.014
Does that help you calm down?

401
00:37:06.915 --> 00:37:09.884
Maybe I pushed you
into this too fast.

402
00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:13.187
We've got a lot going on
in this house,

403
00:37:13.221 --> 00:37:16.257
and maybe we're just
not ready for friends.

404
00:37:25.933 --> 00:37:27.735
Let's fly on over

405
00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:29.237
to the Midwestern region.

406
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.607
Which one is this?
North or South Dakota?

407
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:34.042
South Dakota.

408
00:37:34.074 --> 00:37:35.710
That's right.

409
00:37:35.743 --> 00:37:39.146
Underneath South Dakota is...?

410
00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:42.250
- Nebraska?
- Nebraska.

411
00:37:42.284 --> 00:37:44.286
Jade, what's under Nebraska?

412
00:37:44.319 --> 00:37:45.786
Kansas.

413
00:37:45.819 --> 00:37:47.855
Kansas. Nice one.

414
00:37:47.889 --> 00:37:51.059
Oliver, do you want
to give this one a try?

415
00:37:51.092 --> 00:37:53.596
Oliver, did you bring
your talker today?

416
00:37:56.864 --> 00:37:58.600
Another day.

417
00:37:59.801 --> 00:38:01.569
And under Kansas?

418
00:38:02.603 --> 00:38:04.172
Oklahoma?

419
00:39:17.978 --> 00:39:20.281
Misunderstood Monsters.

420
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.052
"This is Larry.

421
00:39:25.886 --> 00:39:28.122
"Larry never gets
to play pretend.

422
00:39:28.156 --> 00:39:31.159
"He gets made fun of
because he's different.

423
00:39:31.192 --> 00:39:33.161
Larry just wants a friend."

424
00:40:22.777 --> 00:40:24.346
Marty?

425
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.893
Hello?

426
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.810
Hello?

427
00:41:30.277 --> 00:41:31.812
Hello.

428
00:41:41.522 --> 00:41:44.325
Is somebody watching me?

429
00:41:44.359 --> 00:41:47.496
Oliver, what the hell
did you download on this thing?

430
00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:51.433
Say goodbye to Oliver.

431
00:41:51.465 --> 00:41:53.400
Have you been talking to my son?

432
00:41:53.433 --> 00:41:56.203
You need to stop.
This is not funny.

433
00:42:02.409 --> 00:42:06.415
Stay away from my son.
I won't let you hurt him.

434
00:42:07.514 --> 00:42:09.752
Not hurt.

435
00:42:12.085 --> 00:42:14.355
Take.

436
00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:15.857
Take, take,

437
00:42:15.889 --> 00:42:18.192
take, take, take, take.

438
00:42:29.036 --> 00:42:32.507
Why? To collect and...

439
00:42:34.007 --> 00:42:36.377
- Everything okay?
- Sorry. Uh, Oliver?

440
00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:38.446
- Is Oliver here?
- Yeah.

441
00:42:38.478 --> 00:42:40.381
Thank God you're all right.

442
00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:42.150
We got to go.

443
00:42:42.183 --> 00:42:47.121
We have a family emergency,
so we're just gonna go.

444
00:42:50.491 --> 00:42:53.561
We just got to get you home,
okay?

445
00:42:53.594 --> 00:42:56.464
I know. I know this isn't
part of your routine.

446
00:42:56.496 --> 00:42:58.533
It's just...

447
00:43:00.034 --> 00:43:02.369
Someone was watching us at home.

448
00:43:02.402 --> 00:43:04.973
They said they want to take you.

449
00:43:05.005 --> 00:43:07.275
Oh.

450
00:43:09.444 --> 00:43:12.114
Hi. Jen, I can't...

451
00:43:13.647 --> 00:43:16.250
What do you mean,
he's not talking?

452
00:43:17.552 --> 00:43:20.488
I don't know what
they got up to this weekend,

453
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.924
but Byron,
he still hasn't slept.

454
00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:25.327
Won't go to school.

455
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.429
Won't eat.

456
00:43:27.462 --> 00:43:29.431
Two days with him not talking,
and...

457
00:43:29.464 --> 00:43:31.400
I seriously don't know
how you do it.

458
00:43:33.134 --> 00:43:36.471
I think someone hacked
into Oliver's screen.

459
00:43:36.503 --> 00:43:39.241
Someone was talking to me.

460
00:43:47.915 --> 00:43:50.951
SpongeBob, I just want
to say that I'm...

461
00:43:50.985 --> 00:43:53.021
sorry.

462
00:43:53.054 --> 00:43:54.122
What?

463
00:43:54.154 --> 00:43:57.359
I'm trying to say I'm...

464
00:43:59.594 --> 00:44:01.429
What?

465
00:44:01.462 --> 00:44:03.898
I mean, how could someone
use that to get to...

466
00:44:08.268 --> 00:44:10.437
Honey, it's nice of you
to try and apologize,

467
00:44:10.471 --> 00:44:13.308
but I don't think he wants
to watch SpongeBob right now.

468
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.509
It was Larry.

469
00:44:16.043 --> 00:44:17.612
Honey?

470
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.049
Oliver didn't do anything.

471
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:22.417
It was Larry.

472
00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:23.685
Who's Larry?

473
00:44:23.717 --> 00:44:27.554
I read about Larry today
in that story.

474
00:44:27.587 --> 00:44:30.457
Tell me what you saw, please.

475
00:44:30.491 --> 00:44:32.393
Larry just wants a friend.

476
00:44:32.427 --> 00:44:35.330
H-He made the lights go out.

477
00:44:37.297 --> 00:44:39.533
I-I could hear him in the house.

478
00:44:39.567 --> 00:44:42.536
H-He moved things, but...

479
00:44:42.569 --> 00:44:44.906
but I couldn't see him.

480
00:44:45.706 --> 00:44:47.574
Not really.

481
00:44:47.607 --> 00:44:50.077
So, you guys
played make-believe?

482
00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.545
No.

483
00:44:53.348 --> 00:44:56.685
He's the one that hurt me,
not Oliver.

484
00:44:56.717 --> 00:44:58.686
Larry.

485
00:44:58.719 --> 00:45:01.121
I could feel him.

486
00:45:01.154 --> 00:45:03.290
His hands around my neck.

487
00:45:08.128 --> 00:45:10.098
He tried to kill me.

488
00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:14.036
Larry just wants a friend.

489
00:45:15.036 --> 00:45:16.938
Larry just wants a friend.

490
00:45:17.739 --> 00:45:19.574
Larry just wants a friend.

491
00:45:20.574 --> 00:45:22.944
Larry just wants a friend.

492
00:45:26.647 --> 00:45:28.382
Hurry! Oliver!

493
00:45:28.415 --> 00:45:30.952
We got to get to Dad.
We can't stay here.

494
00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:38.326
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing,
but better to be safe, right?

495
00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:40.194
Can you look at me?

496
00:45:43.498 --> 00:45:45.701
We should get going, okay?

497
00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:49.271
And no screens.

498
00:47:50.491 --> 00:47:52.159
Oliver!

499
00:48:26.393 --> 00:48:28.795
What are you talking about?

500
00:48:28.828 --> 00:48:31.198
I know it sounds crazy,

501
00:48:31.232 --> 00:48:33.768
but I was reading this story
about Larry,

502
00:48:33.801 --> 00:48:35.770
and then the lights...

503
00:48:35.802 --> 00:48:38.306
they started going on and off.

504
00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:42.143
And then another one
was going on and off.

505
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:45.779
It was like he was using
the electricity

506
00:48:45.813 --> 00:48:47.382
to move around the room.

507
00:48:47.415 --> 00:48:50.851
And then he screwed in
all the new light bulbs.

508
00:48:50.884 --> 00:48:53.220
So, he helped you
with your chores.

509
00:48:54.922 --> 00:48:59.293
He must have needed the power
or something to come alive.

510
00:48:59.326 --> 00:49:01.362
- Larry?
- Larry.

511
00:49:02.496 --> 00:49:04.766
I knew I shouldn't
have moved out.

512
00:49:05.766 --> 00:49:07.534
I'm not making this up.

513
00:49:07.567 --> 00:49:09.836
Oliver saw him.

514
00:49:09.869 --> 00:49:15.275
There is something
inside our house.

515
00:49:15.308 --> 00:49:18.345
O-Oliver, here.

516
00:49:18.378 --> 00:49:19.915
Tell Daddy.

517
00:49:23.317 --> 00:49:24.953
He.

518
00:49:24.985 --> 00:49:26.920
Wants. Me.

519
00:49:26.953 --> 00:49:29.456
As. Friend.

520
00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:32.560
This thing wants our son.

521
00:49:32.592 --> 00:49:34.395
Okay.

522
00:49:34.427 --> 00:49:37.331
I think you need
a good night's sleep.

523
00:49:37.364 --> 00:49:38.966
I'll take him to school
in the morning.

524
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.402
No, I am not letting him
out of our sight.

525
00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:43.270
How do we know
the school is safe?

526
00:49:43.304 --> 00:49:45.673
Okay, well, why don't I bring
him to work with me tonight

527
00:49:45.706 --> 00:49:47.242
if he's not going
to school tomorrow?

528
00:49:47.275 --> 00:49:48.710
Absolutely not.

529
00:49:48.743 --> 00:49:50.744
Oh, come on. What, you don't
trust me with him?

530
00:49:50.777 --> 00:49:52.546
No, it's not that. It's...

531
00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:55.882
Rest is important for the body.

532
00:49:55.915 --> 00:49:58.485
So, you sleep, and...

533
00:49:58.518 --> 00:50:00.955
we can talk about
all this tomorrow.

534
00:50:02.556 --> 00:50:04.891
Really, come on.

535
00:50:04.924 --> 00:50:07.261
Let me take care of him.

536
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.770
Give this and the change
to the gentleman.

537
00:50:16.804 --> 00:50:18.673
There you go.

538
00:50:18.706 --> 00:50:20.341
Thanks so much.

539
00:50:20.373 --> 00:50:22.909
Have a good one.

540
00:50:22.942 --> 00:50:25.279
My man is a pro!

541
00:50:26.846 --> 00:50:28.782
Very nicely done.

542
00:50:28.815 --> 00:50:31.319
See? Look how good
you are at that.

543
00:50:31.351 --> 00:50:33.754
You could take over for me some nights.

544
00:50:33.788 --> 00:50:34.989
The best part is that,
in between cars,

545
00:50:35.022 --> 00:50:36.023
you can do whatever you want.

546
00:50:36.056 --> 00:50:38.058
You can listen to the radio.

547
00:50:38.092 --> 00:50:40.328
You can even watch SpongeBob.

548
00:50:47.868 --> 00:50:49.471
Oh, hey.

549
00:50:50.705 --> 00:50:53.808
Ah. Is this the infamous haunted screen?

550
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.842
It's okay.

551
00:50:55.875 --> 00:50:58.612
Hey. Do you know how
your nightmares aren't real?

552
00:50:58.645 --> 00:51:02.015
Well, neither are ghosts or
ghouls or vampires or witches,

553
00:51:02.049 --> 00:51:04.052
and certainly not Larrys.

554
00:51:04.085 --> 00:51:06.621
"This is Larry."

555
00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:42.857
"Will you be Larry's friend?"

556
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.413
It's nothing.

557
00:52:05.446 --> 00:52:07.014
Happens all the time.

558
00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:09.016
It's okay.

559
00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:11.919
Huh.

560
00:52:14.554 --> 00:52:15.857
Hang tight.

561
00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:33.407
All right.

562
00:52:35.208 --> 00:52:38.645
Let's see what we have here.

563
00:55:16.936 --> 00:55:18.739
Oliver, what are you doing, buddy?

564
00:55:18.772 --> 00:55:20.975
What if a car drove in? Huh?

565
00:55:21.007 --> 00:55:23.043
You got to be more careful.

566
00:55:28.382 --> 00:55:29.850
Hey. Here.

567
00:55:29.882 --> 00:55:31.085
Give me this.

568
00:55:31.118 --> 00:55:32.953
Look. Hey.

569
00:55:32.987 --> 00:55:34.221
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look.

570
00:55:34.253 --> 00:55:36.022
Buddy, there's nothing.

571
00:55:36.056 --> 00:55:37.592
Hey. Look at me.

572
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:40.194
Okay? There's nothing out there.

573
00:55:40.226 --> 00:55:42.330
Okay? I'll show you. Look.

574
00:55:44.897 --> 00:55:47.033
See?

575
00:55:47.067 --> 00:55:48.703
Look at that.

576
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:58.878
See?

577
00:56:00.279 --> 00:56:01.915
Totally safe.

578
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:12.959
Oliver!

579
00:56:12.993 --> 00:56:15.096
Let him go!

580
00:56:30.944 --> 00:56:32.913
Okay.

581
00:56:32.946 --> 00:56:36.183
Okay. Okay.

582
00:56:36.215 --> 00:56:39.786
I saw through that-that...
that screen

583
00:56:39.819 --> 00:56:42.122
the way he was holding Oliver.

584
00:56:42.156 --> 00:56:44.358
Why does he want our son?

585
00:56:44.391 --> 00:56:47.427
The story said something,
um, about, uh...

586
00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.229
"A true friend
is what you lack."

587
00:56:49.263 --> 00:56:52.433
He hasn't had a friend
since-since...

588
00:56:52.465 --> 00:56:55.168
Oh, yeah, since Jennifer and I
got in our fight.

589
00:56:55.201 --> 00:56:57.337
- I know.
- Yeah, some stupid fight.

590
00:56:57.371 --> 00:56:59.006
Hey, Oliver hit Byron,

591
00:56:59.038 --> 00:57:01.375
and then she decided
our son was dangerous.

592
00:57:02.976 --> 00:57:05.146
Either way, he's been lonely
long before that.

593
00:57:05.179 --> 00:57:06.714
I mean, Oliver's been staring

594
00:57:06.746 --> 00:57:08.449
at his screens for years,
and that...

595
00:57:08.482 --> 00:57:10.851
that thing has been
staring right back.

596
00:57:10.884 --> 00:57:12.719
And how come
we can't see it, huh?

597
00:57:12.752 --> 00:57:14.220
I-I don't know.

598
00:57:14.253 --> 00:57:15.989
Doesn't make any sense.

599
00:57:16.022 --> 00:57:18.892
How-how can he be here
and not here at the same time?

600
00:57:20.159 --> 00:57:21.962
What have you got, honey?

601
00:57:22.962 --> 00:57:25.365
That's very nice.

602
00:57:43.449 --> 00:57:45.218
We got some kid.

603
00:57:45.252 --> 00:57:47.955
Larry's in his world,
and we're in ours, but...

604
00:57:47.987 --> 00:57:50.223
But we're also together.

605
00:57:50.257 --> 00:57:54.095
Larry can interact with us,
but he can't reach us.

606
00:57:54.127 --> 00:57:55.962
He can't get to Oliver yet.

607
00:57:55.996 --> 00:57:58.232
That's why he wants
to get into our world.

608
00:57:58.264 --> 00:58:01.101
If that's his window...

609
00:58:01.134 --> 00:58:04.104
Then we have to destroy it
before it becomes his door.

610
00:58:39.373 --> 00:58:41.942
We have the cookie,
we have the blue car,

611
00:58:41.975 --> 00:58:45.011
and you get to choose...
whichever one you want.

612
00:58:45.045 --> 00:58:46.880
What's it gonna be?

613
00:58:46.913 --> 00:58:48.214
Yeah. Good.

614
00:58:48.248 --> 00:58:50.384
Marty and I
both experienced it.

615
00:58:50.417 --> 00:58:53.052
It's not just
in Oliver's imagination.

616
00:58:53.085 --> 00:58:54.988
I'll be right back, kiddo.

617
00:58:57.523 --> 00:59:02.996
Sarah, do you know
what a physical empath is?

618
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:04.430
No.

619
00:59:04.464 --> 00:59:07.835
It's when you love
someone so much

620
00:59:07.868 --> 00:59:10.571
that you feel or experience
their pain.

621
00:59:10.603 --> 00:59:12.205
It's a good sign.

622
00:59:12.239 --> 00:59:14.175
It shows just how much
you care about Oliver.

623
00:59:14.208 --> 00:59:16.277
And it's very common in parents.

624
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:19.947
So, you're saying that we could
be seeing his imagination

625
00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.415
because we love him?

626
00:59:21.447 --> 00:59:23.183
That doesn't make any sense.

627
00:59:23.217 --> 00:59:24.585
But an invisible monster

628
00:59:24.618 --> 00:59:26.554
that travels
through electricity does?

629
00:59:28.621 --> 00:59:30.924
Well, we're hoping
that that's over now

630
00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:32.526
because we destroyed that thing.

631
00:59:32.558 --> 00:59:36.062
So, does he have a way
to communicate?

632
00:59:37.063 --> 00:59:38.565
I'll...

633
00:59:38.598 --> 00:59:40.867
let him take my phone
with him to school

634
00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.837
until we can afford a new one.

635
00:59:42.869 --> 00:59:44.904
Unless you could get him
talking first.

636
00:59:44.938 --> 00:59:46.607
Sarah.

637
00:59:46.639 --> 00:59:48.609
Come on, it's...

638
00:59:48.641 --> 00:59:51.011
it's extremely rare
for kids his age

639
00:59:51.043 --> 00:59:53.480
to start verbalizing in the way
I fear you're imagining.

640
00:59:53.513 --> 00:59:56.616
I know. I know.

641
00:59:56.650 --> 00:59:59.987
I just...
I just want to make sure

642
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.389
that you still have
the right expectations.

643
01:00:02.422 --> 01:00:04.558
If he can say a few words...

644
01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.594
maybe a sentence here or there...

645
01:00:06.627 --> 01:00:08.596
that would be a big win.

646
01:00:08.628 --> 01:00:12.266
We have to keep remembering
his strengths.

647
01:00:18.639 --> 01:00:20.141
Have you seen him again?

648
01:00:30.284 --> 01:00:32.320
What's this?

649
01:00:33.453 --> 01:00:35.522
He. Gave.

650
01:00:35.554 --> 01:00:39.326
It. To. Me.

651
01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:41.628
Seriously?

652
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:43.330
Yes.

653
01:00:43.362 --> 01:00:48.067
Then Mom and Dad broke him.

654
01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:50.170
Broke him?

655
01:00:50.203 --> 01:00:53.172
S-So, like, he's gone, then?

656
01:00:53.206 --> 01:00:55.376
Yes.

657
01:01:09.556 --> 01:01:12.092
Can I ask you something?

658
01:01:12.125 --> 01:01:13.393
Yes.

659
01:01:13.427 --> 01:01:16.130
Why'd you stop being my friend?

660
01:01:17.397 --> 01:01:20.368
We used to hang out
all the time.

661
01:01:22.368 --> 01:01:25.138
I. Did.

662
01:01:25.172 --> 01:01:27.273
Bad. Thing.

663
01:01:27.306 --> 01:01:28.641
You did?

664
01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:31.077
Punch. Face.

665
01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:34.248
Your. Mom. Mad.

666
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:36.350
I barely even had a bruise.

667
01:01:36.382 --> 01:01:38.217
The next day,
I was asking my mom

668
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:40.321
when we could have
another sleepover.

669
01:01:40.353 --> 01:01:43.256
But she played me
a message from your mom.

670
01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:46.060
Your mom said you didn't want
to be my friend anymore.

671
01:01:49.261 --> 01:01:52.332
That is lie.

672
01:01:52.366 --> 01:01:53.967
Wait.

673
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.502
So, you never said that?

674
01:01:56.536 --> 01:01:58.973
Lie.

675
01:01:59.005 --> 01:02:00.674
Wrong.

676
01:02:00.706 --> 01:02:03.076
I never.

677
01:02:05.277 --> 01:02:06.647
Lie.

678
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:11.552
Moms are so weird.

679
01:02:11.585 --> 01:02:13.420
What are you watching
over there?

680
01:02:13.453 --> 01:02:14.655
Wait.

681
01:02:14.688 --> 01:02:16.423
Let me guess.

682
01:02:16.456 --> 01:02:18.258
SpongeBob?

683
01:02:50.156 --> 01:02:51.424
No.

684
01:04:20.313 --> 01:04:21.682
No!

685
01:04:23.282 --> 01:04:24.750
Help!

686
01:04:24.784 --> 01:04:26.386
Hello!

687
01:04:26.418 --> 01:04:28.254
Somebody help!

688
01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:01.342
Where are you?

689
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.978
No!

690
01:07:05.011 --> 01:07:07.346
Shit.

691
01:07:44.817 --> 01:07:46.919
You need any help
with your homework?

692
01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:53.793
Hey, I talked to Jennifer today.

693
01:07:53.826 --> 01:07:56.462
She said Byron's doing
much better.

694
01:08:06.105 --> 01:08:07.741
Hello?

695
01:08:09.509 --> 01:08:11.110
How?

696
01:08:11.143 --> 01:08:13.679
We found him in his
car on the side of the road.

697
01:08:13.712 --> 01:08:16.782
We're not sure how it happened.
He was unresponsive.

698
01:08:16.816 --> 01:08:18.919
W-We rushed him
to the hospital...

699
01:08:18.951 --> 01:08:21.387
Hello?

700
01:08:25.657 --> 01:08:26.959
Hello?

701
01:08:26.993 --> 01:08:28.995
Hello!

702
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:50.717
Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

703
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:53.018
How may I help you?

704
01:08:53.052 --> 01:08:54.955
- Yeah...
- Did you turn it on?

705
01:08:54.987 --> 01:08:56.990
...two large fries
and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.

706
01:08:57.022 --> 01:08:58.657
Hey! What's that?

707
01:09:00.192 --> 01:09:02.161
What are you doing
behind the counter?!

708
01:09:10.570 --> 01:09:12.539
- He...
- Will...

709
01:09:12.571 --> 01:09:13.873
- Follow...
- You...

710
01:09:15.008 --> 01:09:16.676
- Until...
- You...

711
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:17.844
- Finish...
- The...

712
01:09:17.877 --> 01:09:20.914
Story.

713
01:09:20.946 --> 01:09:23.549
Why are you doing this to us?

714
01:09:25.084 --> 01:09:27.121
Where did you come from?

715
01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:34.660
- World...
- Only...

716
01:09:34.694 --> 01:09:36.196
- Look...
- At...

717
01:09:36.228 --> 01:09:38.197
- Screens...
- Not...

718
01:09:38.231 --> 01:09:39.532
Each other.

719
01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:41.802
What?

720
01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:44.036
What does that mean?

721
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:46.139
- People...
- Very...

722
01:09:46.172 --> 01:09:47.040
Lonely.

723
01:09:47.072 --> 01:09:49.109
- All...
- That...

724
01:09:49.142 --> 01:09:50.710
- Loneliness...
- In...

725
01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:52.846
- World...
- Made...

726
01:09:52.879 --> 01:09:54.815
Larry.

727
01:09:54.847 --> 01:09:56.682
- Larry...
- Made...

728
01:09:56.715 --> 01:09:58.986
- Of...
- Loneliness.

729
01:10:00.085 --> 01:10:02.054
Larry is lonely?

730
01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:07.593
How do you think I would feel
if Larry took Oliver?

731
01:10:12.731 --> 01:10:14.133
- Finish...
- The...

732
01:10:14.167 --> 01:10:15.535
Story.

733
01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:16.936
- Finish...
- The...

734
01:10:16.969 --> 01:10:18.038
Story.

735
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:19.205
No.

736
01:10:25.879 --> 01:10:27.681
No, no, no, no.

737
01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:40.627
No. Stop. Stop.

738
01:11:00.847 --> 01:11:02.581
No. No!

739
01:11:02.615 --> 01:11:03.851
No.

740
01:11:55.133 --> 01:11:58.804
Can you just be normal
for one second?

741
01:12:05.044 --> 01:12:06.746
Oliver.

742
01:12:06.779 --> 01:12:08.848
Oliver, I didn't mean it.

743
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:13.654
Honey.

744
01:12:15.288 --> 01:12:17.691
Sometimes...

745
01:12:17.723 --> 01:12:20.726
even moms and dads say things
that they shouldn't.

746
01:12:22.762 --> 01:12:24.731
I just... I...

747
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:29.369
Your dad...

748
01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:33.639
he's been in an accident,
and, um...

749
01:12:33.673 --> 01:12:35.842
they're trying to wake him up.

750
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:42.014
Something happened to him,
and I think it was Larry.

751
01:12:42.048 --> 01:12:45.085
And I cannot let Larry
get us, too.

752
01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:14.313
Oh, my God.

753
01:14:49.075 --> 01:14:52.946
Okay. Okay. Okay.

754
01:15:20.272 --> 01:15:22.808
We're gonna go for the door.

755
01:15:22.842 --> 01:15:25.044
Stay quiet.

756
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.404
Oliver.

757
01:15:51.437 --> 01:15:53.907
If something happens to us...

758
01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:57.811
...I don't want you to think

759
01:15:57.843 --> 01:16:00.279
that I meant
what I said downstairs.

760
01:16:09.088 --> 01:16:11.057
What did I lie about?

761
01:16:12.357 --> 01:16:14.060
Byron?

762
01:16:15.061 --> 01:16:16.196
Oh, honey, I...

763
01:16:16.228 --> 01:16:18.431
You hit him out of nowhere.

764
01:16:18.463 --> 01:16:20.966
I thought it would be
easier for everyone

765
01:16:20.999 --> 01:16:22.468
if I just cut ties.

766
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:26.972
"You took away...

767
01:16:28.507 --> 01:16:31.044
"...friend.

768
01:16:31.076 --> 01:16:33.312
"Now I...

769
01:16:33.346 --> 01:16:35.549
go with..."

770
01:16:38.551 --> 01:16:40.853
No. No, don't...
d-don't go with Larry.

771
01:16:40.887 --> 01:16:42.188
You're right.

772
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:43.556
I did lie.

773
01:16:43.588 --> 01:16:45.490
And I didn't do it...

774
01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:48.527
Honey, I didn't do it
to protect you.

775
01:16:48.561 --> 01:16:51.598
I did it to protect me.

776
01:16:53.199 --> 01:16:54.634
Oliver.

777
01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:58.036
Can you look at me, please?

778
01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:00.574
Please, can you look at me?

779
01:17:03.008 --> 01:17:04.576
It's okay.

780
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:06.980
I know you're listening.

781
01:17:07.012 --> 01:17:09.148
You're always listening.

782
01:17:12.551 --> 01:17:15.155
Much more than I listen to you.

783
01:17:31.137 --> 01:17:32.572
Oliver.

784
01:17:43.648 --> 01:17:45.218
Oliver.

785
01:17:46.252 --> 01:17:48.254
Hey.

786
01:18:24.255 --> 01:18:28.128
Oliver.

787
01:18:38.404 --> 01:18:41.975
Come...

788
01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:44.511
play.

789
01:19:19.145 --> 01:19:21.481
Friend.

790
01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:28.088
Friend...

791
01:19:40.266 --> 01:19:42.634
F...

792
01:19:42.668 --> 01:19:44.670
F...

793
01:19:47.572 --> 01:19:49.575
F...

794
01:19:51.142 --> 01:19:53.779
F...

795
01:19:53.812 --> 01:19:55.781
Fie-ld.

796
01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:59.485
Field, field, field, field.

797
01:19:59.517 --> 01:20:01.053
Field, field, field,
field, field...

798
01:20:08.259 --> 01:20:10.062
No! No!

799
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.532
Oliver!

800
01:20:26.579 --> 01:20:28.447
Field, field, field, field,
field, field, field, field.

801
01:20:28.481 --> 01:20:30.850
Why the field?

802
01:21:38.383 --> 01:21:40.585
There's no electricity here.

803
01:21:40.619 --> 01:21:42.255
He can't get us.

804
01:21:42.288 --> 01:21:43.857
Hey.

805
01:21:57.703 --> 01:21:58.737
Hey.

806
01:21:58.771 --> 01:21:59.871
Oh, you did it.

807
01:21:59.905 --> 01:22:01.641
You did it.

808
01:22:01.673 --> 01:22:02.841
You saved us.

809
01:22:02.874 --> 01:22:04.377
Oh!

810
01:22:31.704 --> 01:22:34.273
Run!

811
01:22:34.306 --> 01:22:35.741
Run! Come on!

812
01:22:35.773 --> 01:22:37.209
Run!

813
01:23:01.566 --> 01:23:03.703
Stop! No, Oliver!

814
01:23:03.736 --> 01:23:05.938
No.

815
01:23:05.971 --> 01:23:07.272
Oliver.

816
01:23:11.442 --> 01:23:13.445
Oliver!

817
01:23:19.884 --> 01:23:21.686
No!

818
01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:25.924
Oliver!

819
01:24:18.043 --> 01:24:21.580
Friends.

820
01:25:14.732 --> 01:25:16.601
I'll be your friend, Larry.

821
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:21.639
We both want the same thing.

822
01:25:21.673 --> 01:25:24.410
We both want to protect Oliver.

823
01:25:42.527 --> 01:25:44.496
I love you.

824
01:25:45.998 --> 01:25:48.000
I love all of you.

825
01:27:31.069 --> 01:27:32.571
Good.

826
01:27:32.603 --> 01:27:35.007
Now, you want to give it a try?

827
01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.209
M...

828
01:27:38.243 --> 01:27:40.646
Mom...

829
01:27:40.678 --> 01:27:43.214
"Mom." Excellent.

830
01:27:43.248 --> 01:27:47.620
Loves...

831
01:27:49.288 --> 01:27:51.624
M...

832
01:27:51.656 --> 01:27:54.226
Me.

833
01:27:54.258 --> 01:27:55.694
Wonderful.

834
01:27:55.727 --> 01:27:57.696
"Mom loves me."

835
01:27:57.728 --> 01:28:00.165
I know for a fact
your mom loves you very much.

836
01:28:01.667 --> 01:28:03.134
You're so good with him.

837
01:28:03.168 --> 01:28:05.905
So are you.

838
01:28:05.937 --> 01:28:08.007
How's he doing at home?

839
01:28:09.674 --> 01:28:11.209
He seems okay.

840
01:28:12.678 --> 01:28:14.246
I've been trying to give him

841
01:28:14.279 --> 01:28:16.749
more social experiences,
like you said.

842
01:28:16.781 --> 01:28:18.717
Uh, we've been practicing
his speech,

843
01:28:18.749 --> 01:28:21.085
like, uh, five times a day.

844
01:28:21.119 --> 01:28:23.188
Well, you don't want
to wear him out.

845
01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:25.257
Let's say three times a day.

846
01:28:25.289 --> 01:28:28.192
Oh. Okay.

847
01:28:28.226 --> 01:28:30.295
Got it.

848
01:28:33.065 --> 01:28:35.134
Three times a day.

849
01:28:36.368 --> 01:28:39.737
For speech work.

850
01:28:45.377 --> 01:28:48.246
I mean, you know Sarah...
she was...

851
01:28:50.214 --> 01:28:51.883
...incredible.

852
01:28:54.352 --> 01:28:57.989
I thought I understood, but I...

853
01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:08.299
I just wish I could tell her

854
01:29:08.333 --> 01:29:10.570
that I'm sorry.

855
01:29:12.838 --> 01:29:14.740
That I'm trying now.

856
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:19.044
I'm sure she'd like
to hear that.

857
01:29:20.646 --> 01:29:22.615
I hope...

858
01:29:22.647 --> 01:29:24.282
they'll find her.

859
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.795
Is that you?

860
01:29:44.369 --> 01:29:47.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

861
01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.743
Can I, uh...

862
01:29:50.776 --> 01:29:53.245
eat lunch with you guys
tomorrow or something?

863
01:29:53.277 --> 01:29:55.414
That depends.

864
01:29:55.446 --> 01:29:57.815
Are you willing
to take the pledge?

865
01:29:57.848 --> 01:29:59.819
What pledge?

866
01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.657
A secret handshake.

867
01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:07.759
For those of us
who've seen Larry.

868
01:30:07.793 --> 01:30:10.696
The pledge to stay friends.

869
01:30:10.728 --> 01:30:12.364
To play together forever.

870
01:30:12.396 --> 01:30:16.134
So no one has to be alone
like Larry.

871
01:32:13.317 --> 01:32:15.420
I'll protect you.

872
01:32:25.227 --> 01:32:30.227

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:31.011
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

2
00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:33.417
What is this "great"?
Like I'm... I'm...

3
00:00:33.517 --> 00:00:36.170
I'm here as often as I can be.
I'm on two jobs.

4
00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:38.606
I don't know what else
do you want me to do.

MISUNDERSTOOD MONSTERS
A Children's Story

7
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:13.946
This is Larry.

8
00:04:22.947 --> 00:04:25.051
Larry never gets to
play pretend.

9
00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:27.965
He gets made fun of
because he is different.

10
00:04:28.198 --> 00:04:30.584
Larry just wants a friend.

11
00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:58.234
Oliver!

12
00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:00.470
We're okay. We're okay.

13
00:07:00.527 --> 00:07:01.991
What happened, huh?

14
00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:05.203
Can you use your words, please?

15
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:08.474
Here you go.

16
00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:15.323
Something

17
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:17.280
in

18
00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:19.210
house.

19
00:07:19.744 --> 00:07:21.013
Something in house.

20
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.810
That was probably just a nightmare.

21
00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:26.462
Cause there is nobody in the house
but your Mom and your Dad.

22
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:28.070
All right, come here.

23
00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:29.985
Come here. Come here.

24
00:07:30.598 --> 00:07:33.068
Can you take some
deep breaths for me, huh?

25
00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:37.836
Okay? We gonna do
some deep breaths. All right?

26
00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:55.625
So, he woke up in the middle
of the night, screaming.

27
00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:58.519
I went in there. I was up
for two hours with him.

28
00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.298
He's a little boy. He has nightmares.

29
00:08:02.017 --> 00:08:04.977
It's easy for you to say. You never
go in with him. It's always me.

30
00:08:05.124 --> 00:08:07.570
I slept through it.
All right? I'm sorry.

31
00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:11.053
Don't do that. Why can't you just admit
that you don't want to help?

32
00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:14.416
I help. Okay? I always help
when I'm awake.

33
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.974
Hey, buddy.

34
00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.832
No more nightmares, huh?

35
00:08:19.037 --> 00:08:21.096
I heard you had a bad dream, bud?

36
00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:22.663
Need a hug?

37
00:08:23.491 --> 00:08:26.010
I know what the problem is.

38
00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:29.547
Too far away!

39
00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:32.170
Yup, let's see.

40
00:08:32.276 --> 00:08:35.441
Ten feet? That's definitely
too far for a hug.

41
00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:37.633
What do you think five feet is?

42
00:08:38.328 --> 00:08:40.194
Okay. Little closer.

43
00:08:40.435 --> 00:08:43.550
I'm getting the weirdest reading
on this thing. It's just....

44
00:08:44.614 --> 00:08:46.675
Tummy tickles!

45
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:50.534
Your throne, sir.

46
00:08:54.338 --> 00:08:57.002
Are you able to make it
to a speech therapy today?

47
00:08:57.715 --> 00:09:00.650
Sorry, I can't. I picked up a shift
at a parking lot.

48
00:09:01.472 --> 00:09:03.476
Well, hopefully you can
make one soon, right?

49
00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:04.996
Yeah. For sure.

50
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.629
Are

51
00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:09.886
we

52
00:09:11.148 --> 00:09:12.286
moving?

53
00:09:12.346 --> 00:09:14.785
Are we moving?

54
00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:22.417
You are not moving anywhere. Okay?

55
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:24.231
So don't worry.

56
00:09:26.955 --> 00:09:30.687
Today we're gonna start in with multiplying
more than two number.

57
00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:32.122
Not cool, man.

58
00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:34.357
You don't even know
what you're groaning about.

59
00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:35.355
It's not so hard.

60
00:09:35.532 --> 00:09:38.276
If you can multiply two numbers
you can multiply three.

61
00:09:39.154 --> 00:09:41.730
Make sure you pay attention
to the lesson, okay?

62
00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.427
Come on, you learn by trying.

63
00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:46.202
Nobody?

64
00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:48.964
Oliver?

65
00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:53.927
What do you make of this three numbers?

66
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.948
The

67
00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:02.335
answer

68
00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:03.824
is

69
00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:05.880
eight.

70
00:10:06.062 --> 00:10:08.583
- The answer is eight.
- Not quite.

71
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.267
I see what you did there though.
You were adding instead of multiplying.

72
00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:13.985
Very good try, Oliver.
Anyone else wanna give it a go?

73
00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:16.023
Go ahead, Byron.

74
00:10:16.197 --> 00:10:18.919
How come Oliver still gets to use
his phone in the class

75
00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:20.485
but you took mine away?

76
00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:24.274
- He's autistic, dude.
- So he gets special treatment?

77
00:10:24.577 --> 00:10:25.903
Oliver gets to use his phone

78
00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:29.388
because he wasn't playing Fortnite
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

79
00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:32.961
Let's get back to our first pair.

80
00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:36.331
Product of two and four.
Why don't we start there?

81
00:10:42.845 --> 00:10:44.497
Hey, what's up?

82
00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.441
Do you wanna come hang out with us?

83
00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:52.906
Where?

84
00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:57.184
It's just... I saw something cool
over there.

85
00:11:03.148 --> 00:11:05.968
That way. I'll catch up in a sec.

86
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:42.897
Friends?

87
00:11:49.316 --> 00:11:50.731
Hello?

88
00:12:00.973 --> 00:12:01.707
Hey!

89
00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:06.193
- I can't believe he actually fell for it.
- Of course he did. He's such a loser.

90
00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:09.550
Is he having a heart attack?
He totally is. We should call 911.

91
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:11.976
Dude, dude, listen.
That's just how he talks.

92
00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.655
Moaner-boner.

93
00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:17.472
Like, he can't even talk, he's like...

94
00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:25.696
- Exactly.
- Hey, maybe he's a robot under skin?

95
00:12:26.908 --> 00:12:28.617
Moaner-boner thinks he's special.

96
00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:32.304
Oh, did you wanna say something?

97
00:12:32.448 --> 00:12:35.576
I can't believe you should be friends
with moaner-boner over there.

98
00:12:35.733 --> 00:12:37.513
My Mom made me. I didn't want to.

99
00:12:44.387 --> 00:12:46.232
You're very ugly.

100
00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:53.084
Who's ugly now?

101
00:12:55.682 --> 00:12:57.080
Come on!

102
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.424
I didn't know what to think when I pulled up
and he wasn't there waiting for me.

103
00:13:21.828 --> 00:13:24.756
I went right into
the worst case scenarios.

104
00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:28.414
Did he get in trouble?
Did someone take him?

105
00:13:30.004 --> 00:13:34.690
And then I found him
just screaming in the field.

106
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.880
That's sounds very scary for both of you.

107
00:13:37.037 --> 00:13:39.834
And he lost his phone somehow.

108
00:13:40.692 --> 00:13:43.116
I wish he could explain what happened.

109
00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:47.849
Good. Now we're gonna try
using our words.

110
00:13:48.153 --> 00:13:51.256
Lost in field.

111
00:13:52.016 --> 00:13:55.418
We're gonna work on your f's, okay?
F's can be tricky.

112
00:13:56.445 --> 00:14:00.694
Field. Field. Can you try that?

113
00:14:09.286 --> 00:14:11.594
Oliver, you can do it.

114
00:14:17.128 --> 00:14:19.900
Okay, good practicing.

115
00:14:21.102 --> 00:14:25.405
Have you been trying to provide him
with social experiences like we discussed?

116
00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:27.510
Poor guy still doesn't have any friends.

117
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:31.019
You said he was hanging out
with your friend's son?

118
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.435
Jennifer's son, Byron.
Yeah, we're not close anymore.

119
00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:41.178
Okay, so, if you can make any effort
to help him find friends.

120
00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:43.566
Take him to birthday parties, anything.

121
00:14:43.724 --> 00:14:46.375
It can be a good way
to get him to open up.

122
00:14:46.517 --> 00:14:50.880
And just like he's trying to get better at talking,
we have to make sure we're listening.

123
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:06.218
Come on, Oliver,
you gotta stay with me, okay?

124
00:15:23.703 --> 00:15:26.358
Five bucks, please.
Thanks a lot.

125
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:43.861
Oliver, take that box off.

126
00:17:44.016 --> 00:17:47.047
- Oh, buddy.
- It's time to brush your teeth.

127
00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:51.159
- He's full of energy tonight.
- Yeah, he is.

128
00:17:53.468 --> 00:17:54.799
Where did you get that?

129
00:17:55.452 --> 00:17:58.840
Took from "lost & found" at work.
I think it just needs to be charged.

130
00:17:59.035 --> 00:18:00.922
I guess you like it, huh?

131
00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:04.820
Be careful with the screen,
it has a little crack.

132
00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:07.233
- What?
- You know what.

133
00:18:07.382 --> 00:18:11.795
I run around our son all day and you get
to swoop in and be the hero once again?

134
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.614
A hero?

135
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:37.858
It's not all presents and tummy tickles
with me like it is with you.

136
00:18:38.424 --> 00:18:41.563
I just wish I could take that part
of him and put it in the box

137
00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:45.735
and tape it up and hide it somewhere
so I don't have to deal with it.

138
00:18:46.643 --> 00:18:48.816
Then he wouldn't be our Oliver.

139
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:53.261
I should've...

140
00:18:55.507 --> 00:18:57.602
I should've taken him sooner.

141
00:18:59.704 --> 00:19:03.691
What if he never learns to talk
because I didn't do anything for so long?

142
00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:05.675
We didn't do anything.

143
00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:10.773
He has never looked me in the eyes.

144
00:19:11.407 --> 00:19:15.330
Do you know what it's like for your own child
to never look you in the eyes?

145
00:19:17.994 --> 00:19:19.637
Well...

146
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.872
He's got nice eyes, if that helps.

147
00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:29.955
No, Marty, it doesn't help.
Because he loves you and he hates me.

148
00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:42.215
Is

149
00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:43.695
Dad

150
00:23:44.911 --> 00:23:46.254
gone?

151
00:23:49.026 --> 00:23:50.992
Is Dad gone?

152
00:23:52.361 --> 00:23:53.598
Yes.

153
00:23:59.478 --> 00:24:00.663
Hello.

154
00:24:21.533 --> 00:24:22.075
Who

155
00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:23.030
are

156
00:24:23.177 --> 00:24:23.989
you?

157
00:24:44.076 --> 00:24:45.826
I am Larry.

158
00:24:49.664 --> 00:24:54.118
Your friends want you to be normal.

159
00:24:54.843 --> 00:24:59.256
I just want to be your friend.

160
00:25:06.447 --> 00:25:07.983
Hi, honey.

161
00:25:08.868 --> 00:25:10.192
So...

162
00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:12.724
I just had a little chat with Jennifer.

163
00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:16.976
You know how Dr. Robyn's
always talking about you making friends?

164
00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:19.509
Well, we gonna have
a sleepover this weekend.

165
00:25:19.976 --> 00:25:22.368
I know it's scary. I'm nervous too.

166
00:25:22.634 --> 00:25:27.266
I haven't seen Jennifer
since that whole incident,

167
00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:30.092
but you try and have
some fun for me?

168
00:25:35.355 --> 00:25:38.844
You noticed your Dad's gone
earlier than usual, huh?

169
00:25:39.724 --> 00:25:41.931
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

170
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:48.475
I've been wanting to talk to about it for a while
but I just haven't been sure what to say.

171
00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:53.538
Your Dad and I love you so much.
I don't want you to feel alone.

172
00:25:53.674 --> 00:25:56.360
That's why we gonna have
a sleepover this weekend.

173
00:26:18.069 --> 00:26:21.212
Is that your way of saying
you don't wanna talk to me about it?

174
00:26:46.292 --> 00:26:48.122
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

175
00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:50.395
- Thank you for coming.
- Nice to see you.

176
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:51.285
You too.

177
00:26:51.432 --> 00:26:54.080
So, I hope you're gonna be okay
with these guys.

178
00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.226
They can be a little bit of a handful.

179
00:26:57.374 --> 00:26:59.570
Oh, yeah, I think we'll be fine.

180
00:26:59.629 --> 00:27:02.430
Byron just felt more comfortable
with his party.

181
00:27:03.238 --> 00:27:05.430
You're welcome to stay for a while.

182
00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:07.892
And to spend more time
with Byron than I have to?

183
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.071
- Mom!
- Yes! I'm just kidding, honey.

184
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:13.299
Not kidding.

185
00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:17.486
So... can I say hi?

186
00:27:18.578 --> 00:27:20.801
Oh yeah, of course, yes.

187
00:27:23.271 --> 00:27:26.781
Oliver, you remember Jennifer, right?

188
00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:28.360
Hi, Oliver.

189
00:27:29.802 --> 00:27:31.959
Why did he do that weird thing
with his fingers?

190
00:27:32.104 --> 00:27:34.077
- Hey, be nice, guys.
- No, it's okay.

191
00:27:34.847 --> 00:27:37.761
It helps calm him down.
It's called stimming.

192
00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:39.797
K. But why?

193
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.455
Well, he's under sensitive to stimulation
so sometimes he needs to touch his own skin

194
00:27:45.627 --> 00:27:48.331
or spin in a circle
and it makes him feel good.

195
00:27:49.047 --> 00:27:52.541
- Can he spin forever without puking?
- Sure seems like it.

196
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:56.271
- That's kinda cool.
- Come on, Oliver.

197
00:27:57.642 --> 00:28:00.469
Hi, Oliver, it's really nice
to see you, honey.

198
00:28:00.934 --> 00:28:03.079
- My Gosh, you've gotten big.
- Yeah.

199
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.827
He's so not talking
but his writing has really improved.

200
00:28:07.969 --> 00:28:09.321
That awesome!

201
00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:11.695
High five?

202
00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:17.511
Still strong.

203
00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:19.433
Okay, that is not gonna happen.

204
00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:22.935
Because he knows now
to keep his hands to himself.

205
00:28:23.061 --> 00:28:24.973
- Of course.
- Right, Oliver?

206
00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:27.930
Well, the boys have all agreed
to include Oliver,

207
00:28:27.982 --> 00:28:30.795
so I'm sure it's just gonna be
a really great night.

208
00:28:54.112 --> 00:28:56.667
Is he gonna make those sounds
the whole night?

209
00:28:56.814 --> 00:28:58.547
Keep it down!

210
00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:11.851
Isn't it sad your Mom has to force kids
to come over and pretend to be your friends?

211
00:29:11.982 --> 00:29:13.760
What is he staring at anyway?

212
00:29:14.001 --> 00:29:16.649
Moaner-boner has been looking
at that closet all night.

213
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.724
Maybe that's where he keeps
his secret candy stash?

214
00:29:21.848 --> 00:29:24.763
What? You guys are telling me
you don't have a secret candy stash?

215
00:29:24.869 --> 00:29:26.356
I'm gonna check it out.

216
00:29:36.146 --> 00:29:37.954
Do you see any candy?

217
00:29:55.648 --> 00:29:58.644
Hey! What's your deal?! We all got these!

218
00:29:58.802 --> 00:30:00.427
Does he think we're gonna steal it?

219
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:02.876
Let's see what kind of games
you got in here.

220
00:30:04.488 --> 00:30:05.330
What's this?

221
00:30:05.684 --> 00:30:08.036
Does your Mommy still read you
bedtime stories?

222
00:30:12.656 --> 00:30:15.428
- This is Larry.
- Who's Larry?

223
00:30:15.852 --> 00:30:17.061
Yeah, who's Larry?

224
00:30:17.918 --> 00:30:20.547
- This guy.
- Whoa! Look at that dude.

225
00:30:20.758 --> 00:30:22.699
Yeah, he looks just like your Dad.

226
00:30:22.994 --> 00:30:23.965
Shut up!

227
00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.811
And my Dad is way hairier.

228
00:30:28.275 --> 00:30:30.528
Larry never gets to play pretend.

229
00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:33.118
He gets made fun of
because he's different.

230
00:30:34.986 --> 00:30:37.736
Okay, did your parents forget to pay
the electricity bill?

231
00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:43.336
Larry just wants a friend.

232
00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:47.770
I guess you are so afraid
of a dead light bulb.

233
00:30:50.375 --> 00:30:52.335
Two. Two light bulbs.

234
00:31:05.888 --> 00:31:09.014
He's tall, and pale, and thin.

235
00:31:09.148 --> 00:31:11.066
And tries to hide his face.

236
00:31:12.354 --> 00:31:14.563
He isn't from the world you know.

237
00:31:17.005 --> 00:31:19.575
Larry comes from another place.

238
00:31:20.583 --> 00:31:22.301
Maybe we should stop reading.

239
00:31:28.995 --> 00:31:30.958
Larry watches through your windows

240
00:31:31.513 --> 00:31:33.390
which connect his realm to yours.

241
00:31:33.711 --> 00:31:38.413
He needs you to know his whole story
to turn those windows into doors.

242
00:31:38.998 --> 00:31:40.229
What does that mean?

243
00:31:43.048 --> 00:31:44.147
Oh my God!

244
00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.140
Oh my God!

245
00:31:48.452 --> 00:31:49.672
What's going on?

246
00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:56.518
Oh my God!

247
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:06.011
What is happening?

248
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.100
Are you making those sounds moaner-boner?

249
00:33:26.284 --> 00:33:28.741
What the shit is that?

250
00:33:29.948 --> 00:33:32.317
Shit! Shit!

251
00:33:39.324 --> 00:33:41.623
What the hell kinda app is this?
Is it an app?

252
00:33:41.822 --> 00:33:44.146
Should we read the next page?
I wanna read the next page.

253
00:33:44.285 --> 00:33:45.995
No, no! Don't read the next page!

254
00:33:47.597 --> 00:33:50.590
Larry has looked through the glass
and found you staring back.

255
00:33:51.222 --> 00:33:52.969
He understands your loneliness.

256
00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:55.500
A true friend is what you lack.

257
00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.306
Will you be Larry's friend?

258
00:33:59.468 --> 00:34:03.174
No! No! I will not be Larry's friend.

259
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.907
Guys, guys, there's nothing in the corner.

260
00:34:06.787 --> 00:34:08.470
No, no, no!

261
00:34:09.118 --> 00:34:10.131
Don't!

262
00:34:12.786 --> 00:34:14.037
He's going.

263
00:34:15.674 --> 00:34:17.035
See?

264
00:34:21.127 --> 00:34:23.298
It's probably just the fuse.

265
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.360
Do you see him? Do you see Larry?

266
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.817
Guys, there's no such thing as Larry.

267
00:34:29.143 --> 00:34:31.699
It's just your imagination
playing tricks on you.

268
00:34:40.269 --> 00:34:41.785
What is happening?

269
00:34:42.196 --> 00:34:43.895
Oh my God!

270
00:34:44.153 --> 00:34:45.945
Byron, are you okay?

271
00:34:52.967 --> 00:34:54.853
I don't know how this happened.

272
00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:57.815
I don't see how Oliver
could've done this.

273
00:34:57.949 --> 00:35:00.059
Byron? Baby?

274
00:35:00.814 --> 00:35:03.152
Do you think you can tell us
what happened?

275
00:35:03.669 --> 00:35:05.454
Who did this?

276
00:35:08.428 --> 00:35:09.761
It was Oliver.

277
00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.175
He's a freak.

278
00:35:13.206 --> 00:35:14.511
Excuse me?

279
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.719
Let's go.

280
00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:21.801
Jennifer... I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

281
00:35:22.931 --> 00:35:24.340
We gotta go.

282
00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:44.798
How did you blow out all of these lights?

283
00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:49.692
I don't understand, were you trying
to hurt Byron again?

284
00:35:53.513 --> 00:35:54.890
Not you?

285
00:35:53.513 --> 00:35:56.447
Well, who else could've been?

286
00:35:57.134 --> 00:36:00.004
If you want friends
you can't push furniture into them.

287
00:36:00.717 --> 00:36:02.862
Will you at least help me
move this table?

288
00:36:03.778 --> 00:36:07.134
Please stop humming.
We are not happy right now, this...

289
00:36:08.934 --> 00:36:11.545
Is that the Sponge Bob song?

290
00:36:30.593 --> 00:36:33.762
You know what,
you don't have to stop.

291
00:36:36.149 --> 00:36:38.162
Does that help you calm down?

292
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.565
Maybe I pushed you into this too fast.

293
00:36:44.276 --> 00:36:46.959
We've got a lot going on in this house
and maybe we're just

294
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:48.813
not ready for friends.

295
00:37:02.021 --> 00:37:05.363
Which one is this, North or South Dakota?

296
00:37:05.716 --> 00:37:07.513
- South Dakota.
- That's right.

297
00:37:08.705 --> 00:37:11.521
Underneath South Dakota is..?

298
00:37:12.218 --> 00:37:14.500
- Nebraska?
- Nebraska.

299
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:17.297
Jade, what's under Nebraska?

300
00:37:17.456 --> 00:37:19.866
- Kansas.
- Kansas, nice one.

301
00:37:20.986 --> 00:37:23.267
Oliver, do you wanna give us a try?

302
00:37:24.067 --> 00:37:26.354
Oliver, did you bring your talker today?

303
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:31.091
Another day.

304
00:37:32.538 --> 00:37:34.874
And under Kansas?

305
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:36.606
Iowa?

306
00:38:50.871 --> 00:38:53.035
Misunderstood monsters.

307
00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:56.490
This is Larry.

308
00:38:58.385 --> 00:39:00.964
Larry never gets to play pretend.

309
00:39:01.202 --> 00:39:03.854
He get made fun of because he's different.

310
00:39:03.946 --> 00:39:06.373
Larry just wants a friend.

311
00:39:55.614 --> 00:39:57.073
Marty?

312
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.609
Hello?

313
00:40:59.631 --> 00:41:01.020
Hello?

314
00:41:03.738 --> 00:41:05.016
Hello.

315
00:41:14.691 --> 00:41:16.537
Somebody is watching me.

316
00:41:17.389 --> 00:41:20.136
Oliver, what the hell did you download
on this thing?

317
00:41:20.338 --> 00:41:22.956
Say goodbye to Oliver.

318
00:41:24.339 --> 00:41:25.882
Have you been talking to my son?

319
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.661
You need to stop!
This is not funny!

320
00:41:35.898 --> 00:41:38.923
Stay away from my son,
I won't let you hurt him!

321
00:41:40.727 --> 00:41:42.612
Not hurt.

322
00:41:45.074 --> 00:41:47.028
Kill.

323
00:42:06.526 --> 00:42:08.727
- Is everything okay?
- Sorry. Is that Oliver?

324
00:42:09.089 --> 00:42:10.608
- Is Oliver here?
- Yes.

325
00:42:11.907 --> 00:42:14.534
Thank God you're all right. We gotta go.

326
00:42:14.651 --> 00:42:18.554
We have a family emergency.
So we're just gonna go.

327
00:42:23.452 --> 00:42:25.387
Just gonna get you home, okay?

328
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.110
I know. I know this isn't part
of your routine.

329
00:42:29.358 --> 00:42:30.738
It's just...

330
00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.813
Someone was watching us at home.

331
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.730
They said they want to take you.

332
00:42:42.473 --> 00:42:44.628
Hi, Jen, I can't...

333
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:48.248
What do you mean he's not talking?

334
00:42:50.225 --> 00:42:52.521
I don't know what they
got up to this weekend.

335
00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:55.858
But Byron... He still hasn't slept.

336
00:42:56.414 --> 00:42:58.633
Didn't go to school. Won't eat.

337
00:42:59.681 --> 00:43:01.656
Two days of no talking and...

338
00:43:02.314 --> 00:43:04.544
I seriously don't know how you do it.

339
00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.056
I think someone hacked into
Oliver's screen.

340
00:43:09.258 --> 00:43:10.990
Someone was talking to me.

341
00:43:15.077 --> 00:43:16.380
It was so creepy.

342
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.017
How could someone use that to get to...

343
00:43:40.798 --> 00:43:42.922
Honey, it's nice of you
to try and apologize

344
00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:45.807
but I don't think he wants
to watch Sponge Bob right now.

345
00:43:45.895 --> 00:43:46.944
It was Larry.

346
00:43:48.485 --> 00:43:49.753
Honey?

347
00:43:51.794 --> 00:43:53.488
Oliver didn't do anything.

348
00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:55.843
- It was Larry.
- Who's Larry?

349
00:43:56.022 --> 00:43:59.180
I read about Larry today in that story.

350
00:44:00.355 --> 00:44:02.419
Tell me what you saw, please.

351
00:44:03.406 --> 00:44:07.301
Larry just wants a friend.
He made the lights go out.

352
00:44:09.612 --> 00:44:11.486
I could hear him in the house.

353
00:44:12.393 --> 00:44:13.835
He moved things.

354
00:44:15.363 --> 00:44:17.238
But I couldn't see him.

355
00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:19.422
Not really.

356
00:44:20.414 --> 00:44:23.016
- So you guys played "Make believe"?
- No.

357
00:44:25.806 --> 00:44:27.351
He's the one that hurt me.

358
00:44:27.602 --> 00:44:30.340
It's not Oliver, Larry.

359
00:44:31.183 --> 00:44:35.650
I could feel him,
his hands around my neck.

360
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:42.591
He tried to kill me.

361
00:44:44.885 --> 00:44:49.076
Larry just wants a friend.

362
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.751
Hurry, Oliver, we gotta get to Dad,
we can't stay here.

363
00:45:06.792 --> 00:45:10.835
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing
but better to be safe, right?

364
00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:12.567
Can you look at me?

365
00:45:16.035 --> 00:45:17.856
We should get going, okay?

366
00:45:19.784 --> 00:45:21.301
And no screens!

367
00:47:22.927 --> 00:47:24.230
Oliver!

368
00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.233
What are you talking about?

369
00:48:01.406 --> 00:48:03.082
I know it sounds crazy.

370
00:48:03.406 --> 00:48:05.735
But I was reading this story about Larry,

371
00:48:06.051 --> 00:48:09.708
and then the lights...
they started going on and off.

372
00:48:10.567 --> 00:48:14.143
And then another one was going on and off.

373
00:48:15.508 --> 00:48:19.867
It was like he was using the electricity
to move around the room.

374
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:22.887
And then he screwed in
all the new light bulbs.

375
00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:24.829
So he helped you with your chores?

376
00:48:25.479 --> 00:48:27.131
No.

377
00:48:27.419 --> 00:48:31.168
He must've needed the power
or something to come alive.

378
00:48:31.877 --> 00:48:33.355
- Larry?
- Larry.

379
00:48:34.694 --> 00:48:37.039
I knew I shouldn't have moved out.

380
00:48:37.974 --> 00:48:40.168
I am not making this up!

381
00:48:40.347 --> 00:48:42.063
Oliver saw him.

382
00:48:42.828 --> 00:48:46.543
There is something inside our house.

383
00:48:49.058 --> 00:48:51.466
Oliver, here, tell Daddy.

384
00:48:55.627 --> 00:49:01.785
He wants me as friend.

385
00:49:01.812 --> 00:49:04.253
This thing wants our son.

386
00:49:05.053 --> 00:49:06.200
Okay.

387
00:49:06.466 --> 00:49:09.145
I think you need a good night sleep.

388
00:49:09.402 --> 00:49:11.176
I'll take him to the school
in the morning.

389
00:49:11.332 --> 00:49:15.184
No, I am not letting him out of our sight.
How do we know the school is safe?

390
00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.861
Okay, well, why don't I bring him
to work with me tonight

391
00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:20.598
- if he's not going to school tomorrow.
- Absolutely not!

392
00:49:20.914 --> 00:49:22.723
Come on, you don't trust me with?

393
00:49:22.882 --> 00:49:25.210
- No, it's not that, it's...
- Rest

394
00:49:25.765 --> 00:49:27.942
is important for the body.

395
00:49:28.312 --> 00:49:32.591
So you sleep and we can talk about
all of this tomorrow.

396
00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.360
Come on.

397
00:49:37.539 --> 00:49:39.009
Let me take care of him.

398
00:49:45.313 --> 00:49:48.067
Give this and the change to the gentlemen.

399
00:49:49.567 --> 00:49:50.624
There you go.

400
00:49:51.278 --> 00:49:53.622
Thanks so much. Have a good one.

401
00:49:55.336 --> 00:49:57.171
My man is the pro!

402
00:49:59.092 --> 00:50:01.137
Very nicely done.

403
00:50:01.167 --> 00:50:03.333
See? Look how good you are at that.

404
00:50:03.466 --> 00:50:05.423
You can take over from me some nights.

405
00:50:05.552 --> 00:50:08.485
The best part is that in-between cars
you can do whatever you want.

406
00:50:08.624 --> 00:50:10.163
You can listen to the radio...

407
00:50:10.323 --> 00:50:11.983
You can even watch Sponge Bob.

408
00:50:23.488 --> 00:50:26.042
Is this the infamous hunted screen?

409
00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.476
It's okay.

410
00:50:27.974 --> 00:50:30.377
Hey, you know how your nightmares
aren't real?

411
00:50:30.675 --> 00:50:33.907
Well, neither are ghosts or ghouls,
or vampires, or witches,

412
00:50:34.063 --> 00:50:35.668
and certainly not Larry's.

413
00:50:36.991 --> 00:50:38.631
This is Larry.

414
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:14.712
Will you be Larry's friend?

415
00:51:15.237 --> 00:51:17.916
He promises to protect you
from monsters and from men.

416
00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:24.535
Once you take Larry's hand
you'll never be alone again.

417
00:51:35.515 --> 00:51:37.245
It's nothing.

418
00:51:37.846 --> 00:51:40.214
Happens all the time. It's okay.

419
00:51:47.257 --> 00:51:48.456
Hang tight.

420
00:52:03.185 --> 00:52:04.793
All right.

421
00:52:07.277 --> 00:52:09.940
Let's see what we have here.

422
00:54:48.472 --> 00:54:50.410
Oliver, what are you doing, buddy?

423
00:54:51.156 --> 00:54:52.881
What if a car drove in, huh?

424
00:54:53.045 --> 00:54:54.522
You gotta be more careful.

425
00:55:00.519 --> 00:55:03.437
Hey. Here. Give me this. Look. Hey.

426
00:55:04.705 --> 00:55:05.902
Hey, hey...

427
00:55:06.076 --> 00:55:08.796
Buddy, there's nothing...
Hey, look at me.

428
00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.607
There is nothing out there, okay?

429
00:55:12.675 --> 00:55:14.347
I'll show you. Look.

430
00:55:17.366 --> 00:55:20.089
See? Look at that.

431
00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:31.603
See?

432
00:55:31.855 --> 00:55:33.220
Totally safe.

433
00:55:44.324 --> 00:55:45.519
Oliver!

434
00:55:45.882 --> 00:55:47.299
Let him go!

435
00:56:02.656 --> 00:56:04.852
Okay.

436
00:56:08.384 --> 00:56:11.245
I saw it through that screen.

437
00:56:12.028 --> 00:56:13.943
The way he was holding Oliver.

438
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.195
Why does he want our son?

439
00:56:16.204 --> 00:56:18.618
The story said something about...

440
00:56:19.491 --> 00:56:22.925
A true friend is what you lack.
He hasn't had a friend since...

441
00:56:24.655 --> 00:56:27.406
Oh, yeah, since Jennifer and I
got into a fight, I know.

442
00:56:27.565 --> 00:56:28.644
Stupid fight.

443
00:56:28.962 --> 00:56:33.036
Oliver hit Byron, and then she decided
our son was dangerous.

444
00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:37.093
Either way he's been lonely
long before that.

445
00:56:37.259 --> 00:56:40.400
I mean Oliver has been staring
at his screens for years. And that...

446
00:56:40.557 --> 00:56:42.778
That thing has been staring right back.

447
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.479
How come we can't see it, huh?

448
00:56:44.784 --> 00:56:46.721
- I don't know.
- Doesn't make any sense.

449
00:56:46.868 --> 00:56:50.045
How can he be here
and not here at the same time?

450
00:56:52.122 --> 00:56:53.917
What do you got, honey?

451
00:56:54.997 --> 00:56:56.765
That's very nice.

452
00:57:15.292 --> 00:57:16.716
We got some kid.

453
00:57:17.077 --> 00:57:19.375
Larry's in his word,
and we're in ours. But...

454
00:57:19.499 --> 00:57:21.076
We're also together.

455
00:57:22.179 --> 00:57:25.426
Larry can interact with us
but he can't reach us,

456
00:57:25.568 --> 00:57:27.336
he can't get to Oliver yet.

457
00:57:27.657 --> 00:57:29.633
That why he wants to get into our world.

458
00:57:30.249 --> 00:57:32.262
If that's his window...

459
00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:36.083
Then we have to destroy it
before it becomes his door.

460
00:58:11.278 --> 00:58:15.388
We have a cookie. We have a blue car and
you get to choose. Whichever one you want.

461
00:58:16.696 --> 00:58:18.354
What's it gonna be?

462
00:58:18.557 --> 00:58:19.948
Yeah. Good.

463
00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:24.271
Marty and I both experienced it,
it's not just an Oliver's imagination.

464
00:58:24.632 --> 00:58:26.399
I'll be right back, kiddo.

465
00:58:29.776 --> 00:58:34.203
Sarah, do you know what a
physical empath is?

466
00:58:34.915 --> 00:58:36.012
No.

467
00:58:36.264 --> 00:58:39.513
It's when you love someone so much

468
00:58:40.136 --> 00:58:44.216
that you feel or experience their pain.
It's a good sign.

469
00:58:44.828 --> 00:58:49.050
It shows just how much you care about Oliver
and it's very common in parents.

470
00:58:49.844 --> 00:58:55.125
So you're saying that we could be seeing
his imagination because we love him?

471
00:58:55.275 --> 00:58:57.298
That doesn't make any sense.

472
00:58:57.521 --> 00:59:01.313
But an invisible monster that travels
through electricity does?

473
00:59:03.778 --> 00:59:07.700
We are hoping that that's over now
because we destroyed that thing.

474
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.324
So does he have a way to communicate?

475
00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:18.174
I'll let him take my phone with him
to school until we can afford a new one.

476
00:59:18.817 --> 00:59:21.201
Unless you could get him talking first.

477
00:59:21.293 --> 00:59:22.666
Sarah.

478
00:59:23.427 --> 00:59:24.875
Come on, it's...

479
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.932
It's extremely rare for kids his age
to start verbalizing

480
00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:31.310
in a way I fear you're imagining.

481
00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:33.776
I know. I know.

482
00:59:34.392 --> 00:59:40.658
I just... I just wanna make sure
that you still have the right expectations.

483
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:47.377
If he can say a few words, maybe a sentence
here and there that would be a big win.

484
00:59:48.623 --> 00:59:52.255
We have to keep remembering his strengths.

485
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:00.790
Have you seen him again?

486
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:13.716
What's this?

487
01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:20.353
He gave it to me.

488
01:00:22.028 --> 01:00:23.440
Seriously?

489
01:00:25.138 --> 01:00:26.417
Yes.

490
01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:31.461
Then Mom and Dad broke him.

491
01:00:32.014 --> 01:00:35.562
Broke him? So like he's gone now?

492
01:00:37.358 --> 01:00:38.903
Yes.

493
01:00:55.893 --> 01:00:57.656
Can I ask you something?

494
01:00:58.744 --> 01:00:59.956
Yes.

495
01:01:00.739 --> 01:01:03.097
Why did you stop being my friend?

496
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:07.117
We used to hang out all of the time.

497
01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:14.869
I did bad thing.

498
01:01:15.474 --> 01:01:16.548
You did?

499
01:01:17.124 --> 01:01:19.338
Punch face.

500
01:01:20.099 --> 01:01:22.719
Your Mom mad.

501
01:01:23.022 --> 01:01:25.094
I barely even had a bruise.

502
01:01:25.426 --> 01:01:28.888
The next day I was asking my Mom
when we get up another sleepover

503
01:01:30.212 --> 01:01:32.603
but she played me a message
from your Mom.

504
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.263
You Mom said you didn't wanna
be my friend anymore.

505
01:01:39.717 --> 01:01:42.156
That is lie.

506
01:01:43.495 --> 01:01:46.354
Wait, so you never said that?

507
01:01:47.732 --> 01:01:49.121
Lie.

508
01:01:50.469 --> 01:01:51.808
Wrong.

509
01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:54.696
I never.

510
01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:58.289
Lie.

511
01:02:01.668 --> 01:02:03.655
You are so weird.

512
01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.761
What are you watching over there?

513
01:02:07.049 --> 01:02:09.253
Wait, let me guess.

514
01:02:10.031 --> 01:02:11.588
Sponge Bob?

515
01:02:47.144 --> 01:02:48.413
No!

516
01:02:55.923 --> 01:02:58.671
When he crawls into your world
he'll quickly take a friend.

517
01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:02.148
For Larry will only have a little time

518
01:03:04.135 --> 01:03:06.567
before he flickers again.

519
01:03:09.849 --> 01:03:12.211
Larry will not stop

520
01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.196
until he has

521
01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:18.805
a new friend.

522
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.270
If someone dares to get in his way

523
01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:26.051
they'll surely face their end.

524
01:04:31.194 --> 01:04:32.683
Help!

525
01:04:33.017 --> 01:04:34.303
Hello?!

526
01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:36.086
Somebody help!

527
01:07:25.338 --> 01:07:26.902
Where are you?

528
01:08:15.507 --> 01:08:17.574
You need any help with your homework?

529
01:08:23.045 --> 01:08:24.993
I talked to Jennifer today.

530
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.733
She said Byron's doing much better.

531
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.555
Hello?

532
01:08:43.645 --> 01:08:44.243
How?

533
01:08:44.593 --> 01:08:47.358
We found him in his car
on the side of the road.

534
01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:51.362
We're not sure how it happened,
he was unresponsive.

535
01:08:51.654 --> 01:08:53.441
We rushed him to the hospital...

536
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:55.862
Hello?

537
01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.573
Did you turn it on?

538
01:09:50.807 --> 01:09:54.282
He will follow you

539
01:09:55.554 --> 01:09:57.874
until you finish

540
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:00.173
the story.

541
01:10:02.582 --> 01:10:05.072
Why are you doing this to us?

542
01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.812
Where did you come from?

543
01:10:15.263 --> 01:10:17.863
World only look

544
01:10:18.494 --> 01:10:20.038
at screens

545
01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.152
not each other.

546
01:10:25.282 --> 01:10:27.048
What does that mean?

547
01:10:28.086 --> 01:10:31.107
People very lonely.

548
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:34.709
All that loneliness

549
01:10:34.876 --> 01:10:38.549
in world made Larry

550
01:10:39.918 --> 01:10:43.893
Larry made of loneliness.

551
01:10:46.317 --> 01:10:48.395
Larry is lonely?

552
01:10:49.532 --> 01:10:51.686
How do you think I would feel

553
01:10:52.176 --> 01:10:54.278
if Larry took Oliver?

554
01:10:59.934 --> 01:11:02.413
Finish the story.

555
01:11:02.697 --> 01:11:05.835
Finish the story.

556
01:11:06.258 --> 01:11:07.386
No!

557
01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:15.660
No! No!

558
01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:20.905
If you feel broken, sad, or odd

559
01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:26.214
Larry likes you even so.

560
01:11:27.004 --> 01:11:29.002
No. Stop! Stop.

561
01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:32.517
When your hand

562
01:11:33.618 --> 01:11:34.314
meets his...

563
01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.173
Larry can never let go.

564
01:11:47.277 --> 01:11:48.378
The End.

565
01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:51.040
No!

566
01:12:43.657 --> 01:12:46.970
Can you just be normal for one second?

567
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.440
Oliver? Oliver, I didn't mean it.

568
01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:01.301
Honey.

569
01:13:03.423 --> 01:13:08.658
Sometimes even Moms and Dads
say things that they shouldn't.

570
01:13:10.894 --> 01:13:12.437
I just...

571
01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.369
Your Dad.

572
01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:19.714
He's been in an accident.

573
01:13:20.152 --> 01:13:23.455
And they are trying to wake him up.

574
01:13:25.796 --> 01:13:29.147
Something happened to him
and I think it was Larry.

575
01:13:30.237 --> 01:13:33.056
And I cannot let Larry get us, too.

576
01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:02.722
Oh my God.

577
01:16:07.967 --> 01:16:10.060
We're gonna go for the door.

578
01:16:10.713 --> 01:16:12.260
Stay quiet.

579
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:41.289
Oliver, if something happens to us

580
01:16:43.825 --> 01:16:48.144
I don't want you to think that I meant
what I said downstairs.

581
01:16:54.554 --> 01:16:56.042
You lies.

582
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.716
What did I lie about?

583
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.560
Byron?

584
01:17:03.372 --> 01:17:06.259
Honey, you hit him out of nowhere.

585
01:17:06.558 --> 01:17:09.919
I thought it would be easier
for everyone if I just cut ties.

586
01:17:12.991 --> 01:17:15.964
You took away friend.

587
01:17:18.945 --> 01:17:22.454
Now I go with

588
01:17:24.092 --> 01:17:25.490
Larry.

589
01:17:26.658 --> 01:17:29.865
No. No. Don't go with Larry. You're right.

590
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.186
I did lie. And I didn't do it...

591
01:17:33.825 --> 01:17:36.485
Honey, I didn't do it to protect you.

592
01:17:36.642 --> 01:17:39.166
I did it to protect me.

593
01:17:41.217 --> 01:17:42.596
Oliver.

594
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.451
Can you look at me, please?

595
01:17:46.106 --> 01:17:48.431
Please, can you look at me?

596
01:17:50.768 --> 01:17:54.172
It's okay. I know you're listening.

597
01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:56.756
You're always listening.

598
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:02.850
Much more than I listen to you.

599
01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.858
Oliver.

600
01:18:32.154 --> 01:18:33.290
Oliver.

601
01:19:12.446 --> 01:19:15.562
I'm waiting, friend.

602
01:19:26.677 --> 01:19:31.368
Come to Larry.

603
01:20:13.085 --> 01:20:15.003
Friend.

604
01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:45.684
Field. Field.

605
01:21:16.132 --> 01:21:17.524
Why the field?

606
01:21:40.612 --> 01:21:41.882
Come on!

607
01:21:43.172 --> 01:21:44.130
Go!

608
01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:28.037
There's no electricity here.

609
01:22:28.661 --> 01:22:30.153
He can't get us.

610
01:22:46.523 --> 01:22:47.712
You did!

611
01:22:47.844 --> 01:22:50.608
You did it! You saved us!

612
01:23:20.113 --> 01:23:21.442
Run!

613
01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.140
Come on! Run!

614
01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:51.613
Oliver!

615
01:23:59.255 --> 01:24:00.945
Over here!

616
01:24:11.968 --> 01:24:13.398
Oliver!

617
01:25:05.752 --> 01:25:08.677
Friends.

618
01:26:02.265 --> 01:26:04.798
I'll be your friend, Larry.

619
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.833
We both want the same thing.

620
01:26:09.701 --> 01:26:12.113
We both wanna protect Oliver.

621
01:26:29.932 --> 01:26:31.958
I love you.

622
01:26:33.307 --> 01:26:35.329
I love all of you.

623
01:27:28.173 --> 01:27:29.505
Mom!

624
01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.325
Mom!

625
01:27:37.186 --> 01:27:39.013
No!

626
01:28:18.485 --> 01:28:19.590
Good.

627
01:28:19.951 --> 01:28:21.726
Now you wanna give it a try?

628
01:28:28.225 --> 01:28:30.228
"Mom", excellent.

629
01:28:32.969 --> 01:28:35.154
loves

630
01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:40.689
me.

631
01:28:41.099 --> 01:28:42.410
Wonderful.

632
01:28:42.575 --> 01:28:44.596
Mom loves me.

633
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.499
I know for a fact your Mom
loved you very much.

634
01:28:48.864 --> 01:28:50.716
You're so good with him.

635
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.361
So are you.

636
01:28:53.358 --> 01:28:55.086
How is he doing at home?

637
01:28:56.754 --> 01:28:58.105
He seems okay.

638
01:28:59.766 --> 01:29:03.789
We've been trying to give him more
social experiences like you said.

639
01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:06.545
And we've been practicing
a speech, like...

640
01:29:06.914 --> 01:29:08.030
five times a day?

641
01:29:08.417 --> 01:29:10.813
Well, you don't wanna wear him out.

642
01:29:10.936 --> 01:29:13.238
- Let's say three times a day.
- Okay.

643
01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:16.816
Got it.

644
01:29:20.249 --> 01:29:25.770
Three times a day for speech work.

645
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:35.053
You know our Sarah, she was...

646
01:29:37.542 --> 01:29:38.981
incredible.

647
01:29:41.454 --> 01:29:44.637
I thought I understood, but I...

648
01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:54.961
I just wish I could tell her

649
01:29:55.591 --> 01:29:57.171
that I'm sorry.

650
01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:01.709
That I'm trying now.

651
01:30:03.624 --> 01:30:06.263
I'm sure she'd like to hear that.

652
01:30:07.631 --> 01:30:10.987
I hope they'll find her.

653
01:30:21.847 --> 01:30:23.541
Is that you?

654
01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:32.499
Hey.

655
01:30:33.237 --> 01:30:34.244
Hey.

656
01:30:36.087 --> 01:30:39.691
Can I eat lunch with you guys
tomorrow or something?

657
01:30:40.212 --> 01:30:41.563
That depends.

658
01:30:42.739 --> 01:30:44.475
Are you willing to take the pledge?

659
01:30:45.059 --> 01:30:46.580
What pledge?

660
01:30:49.562 --> 01:30:51.173
A secret handshake.

661
01:30:51.775 --> 01:30:53.698
For those of us who's seen Larry.

662
01:30:54.554 --> 01:30:56.113
The pledge to stay friends.

663
01:30:57.904 --> 01:31:01.154
To play together forever,
so no one has to be alone

664
01:31:01.398 --> 01:31:02.656
like Larry.

665
01:33:00.399 --> 01:33:02.411
I'll protect you.

666
01:33:05.699 --> 01:33:10.699

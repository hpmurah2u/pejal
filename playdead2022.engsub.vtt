3
00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:19.347
My...my name
is Chloe Albright.

4
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.715
I am a second-year
medical student.

5
00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.119
Yes, of course. Yeah.

6
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.521
No, I just... I, um...

7
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.090
I don't understand
this foreclosure notice.

8
00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.429
Yeah, no, I spoke to
the regional manager, actually,

9
00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:37.365
on...on March 25th

10
00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:40.100
and then again on May 17th.

11
00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:43.604
What?

12
00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:47.208
No... No, no, no. I...

13
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.542
Yeah, no, I know that,

14
00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:50.744
but my student loan
got suspended

15
00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:54.382
and my dad's life insurance,
it never paid out.

16
00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.619
Why?

17
00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:02.323
Because suicide isn't covered.

18
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.728
Look, um...

19
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:12.132
This...this house is all that
my brother and I have left, OK?

20
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.035
No.

21
00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.205
No, you...you cannot
take it from us, OK?

22
00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:18.706
If you evict us from our home,

23
00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.441
then we will have
nowhere else to go.

24
00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:23.143
Hello?

25
00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.647
Hello?

26
00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:31.419
Damn you.

27
00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:48.302
Come on, TJ. Don't ignore me.

28
00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:54.141
Do you know '1984'
was supposed to be,

29
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.843
you know, like,
a cautionary tale

30
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.177
for us average Joes?

31
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.513
Not a...not a goddamn
instruction manual

32
00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.181
for the rich...

33
00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:03.451
..b-bitches that run the show.

34
00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:05.453
You know, I mean,
they read the book and go,

35
00:03:05.486 --> 00:03:07.288
"Hey, th-th-these
are some great ideas.

36
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:10.358
"Let's...let's do this."

37
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.625
Mind control for dummies.

38
00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.262
I mean, c-c-can you

39
00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:16.163
b-b-believe that shit?

40
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.332
And cell phones. Cell phones.

41
00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.634
That's real b-big brother

42
00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.871
except they don't need
to brainwash us to use them.

43
00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:26.440
We pay for the privilege.

44
00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:28.542
I mean, cops, politicians,

45
00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.210
they don't protect and serve us.

46
00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:33.481
They protect and serve
the hard-cash overlords from us.

47
00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.016
They sell us the idea of freedom

48
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.218
while making sure
we never get it.

49
00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:43.123
It's...it's all psychopaths
who say, "2 plus 2 equals 5,"

50
00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.225
who say the best we're gonna get

51
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.296
is...is a boot in the face.

52
00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.164
Bro! Could you just
shut the fuck up?

53
00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.834
No, no, because if you ask me...

54
00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.737
Shut... Hey, give me
the fuckin' book!

55
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.839
No more Book Club, Oprah.

56
00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.775
-Alright? Goddamn!
-Fine, fine! OK!

57
00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.680
Let's do this, man.

58
00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.083
OK.

59
00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:13.721
We got this.

60
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.356
-Alright.
-No, whoa, whoa, whoa!

61
00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.558
What are you doing, Book Club?

62
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.627
You're the driver.
You're stayin' here.

63
00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:23.163
I... Yeah, no, I know. I, um...

64
00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.599
You know, I hate to be
the one to tell you this.

65
00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:26.934
I don't have a licence.

66
00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.168
You don't have
a driver's licence?

67
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.269
-Yeah.
-Oh, holy fuck.

68
00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:30.704
What are we gonna do about you

69
00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:32.105
not having
a driver's licence right now?

70
00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.407
I...I...I don't know.

71
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:34.908
-I don't know.

72
00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:37.044
Dude, guess I'm just gonna
have to fuckin' kill you.

73
00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:38.912
Whoa, whoa! OK, wait.
You said no-one was gonna...

74
00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.414
-Fuck!

75
00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:42.383
-Fuck you!

76
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:43.884
Fuck!

77
00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:45.719
Dude, I could have poked
my fucking eye out!

78
00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:47.921
What do you think, I got
a real gun or something?

79
00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.957
No, I don't know, I don't know!

80
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.625
OK.

81
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.060
-Right pedal's gas.
-I know, I know.

82
00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.695
Left pedal's...
Oh, you know so fucking much?

83
00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:56.263
But you don't have
a driver's licence.

84
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.198
Yes, I know, I know. I just...

85
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.435
Look, I'm just... Look,
I'm still getting my cut, right?

86
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.171
TJ, I'm only doing this
so you get your fucking cut.

87
00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:06.940
-You know that, right?
-Yes, I do.

88
00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:08.409
That's the only reason I'm here.

89
00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:09.877
I know.

90
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.579
Thanks.

91
00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.648
Seriously, we...we, you know...

92
00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:16.617
..be...we'd be dead
without you, so...

93
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.085
-I got you.
-Yeah.

94
00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:20.320
You just...keep it runnin'.

95
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:21.755
I know.

96
00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:25.726
-Just be careful, OK?
-Yeah.

97
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.495
-Alright?
-Alright.

98
00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.130
Right pedal, gas.
Left pedal, brake.

99
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.665
Brake. Yeah, I know.

100
00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.941
Less than a minute, alright?

101
00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.943
Yeah, just hurry, OK?

102
00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:00.193
Alright.

103
00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.596
Alright.

104
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.532
Right pedal... Right.

105
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.811
-Oh! Shit!

106
00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.180
-Let's go!

107
00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.883
Start the car!

108
00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.718
Hey, you punk!

109
00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:27.488
-Go!

110
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:28.722
-Come on!
-Just start the car!

111
00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:30.858
-Start the fucking car!
-Get out of here!

112
00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:53.714
Hello?

113
00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:59.152
Hello?

114
00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:00.420
Chloe, it's me.

115
00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.055
-Can you let me in?
-Oh.

116
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.093
TJ. Hi... Whoa.

117
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.501
-Fuck! Ow!
-Hold still, hold still.

118
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.503
-Shit, Chloe! God.
-Yeah, shit is right.

119
00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:17.170
What the hell were you thinking?

120
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:20.641
No...no-one
was supposed to get hurt.

121
00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:23.877
OK? Ross said that it...

122
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:27.715
Wait... Ross?

123
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:31.685
TJ, you...you pulled
this shit with Ross?

124
00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:33.687
I couldn't do it alone.

125
00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:37.424
I've told you to stay away
from him so many times.

126
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.794
You dated him for three years.
You know he's not a bad guy.

127
00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:42.362
He's bad news, TJ.

128
00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:46.099
-Fuck!
-It's out.

129
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.801
Chloe!

130
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.606
He's not a bad guy, OK?
He just...

131
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.043
Things got away from him.

132
00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.578
Things didn't get away from him.

133
00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.313
He pushed them away.
We can't be like him, TJ.

134
00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:02.983
-You cannot be like him.
-He's dead.

135
00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.688
I think. I don't...

136
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.858
I don't know.

137
00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.701
It's not easy...

138
00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.637
..for me, Chloe, OK?

139
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:25.438
You know, you handle all...

140
00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:28.175
You think that this
is easy for me?

141
00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:33.480
No. No, I did this for you, OK?

142
00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.784
-What?
-OK, I...

143
00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:41.755
I know you're having
trou-trouble with tuition.

144
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.490
And...

145
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.158
..now they're gonna
take the house.

146
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.094
And I...I just
wanted to help, OK?

147
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:48.696
I know how this is
gonna affect you.

148
00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:49.963
I just...I just want to help.

149
00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.966
I couldn't just st-stand by...

150
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.004
..and let you go
through this, you know?

151
00:08:58.405 --> 00:08:59.907
No, I know.

152
00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.878
I know, OK? I fucked up.

153
00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:06.580
I fucked up.

154
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:13.253
Another one bites the dust.

155
00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:20.060
Yeah, get the coroner
and his meat wagon here ASAP.

156
00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:22.195
I don't want the locals
looking at this dead hoodlum

157
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:23.631
bleeding in the street.

158
00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.034
You get a plate
on our wheel man?

159
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.501
-No plate, Sheriff.
-Description?

160
00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.337
-Ski masks.
-Sheriff.

161
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.205
We've got a flaming car
out on Mission Road.

162
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.141
Sounds like a match
for your getaway vehicle.

163
00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:35.743
Huh.

164
00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.377
Well, ain't that a thing?

165
00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:39.813
Looks like our wheel man's

166
00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:41.548
the brains
of this cluster fuck.

167
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.817
OK, I'm going to
ask you some questions, yeah?

168
00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:45.185
Mm-hmm.

169
00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:47.020
-TJ?
-Yeah, yeah.

170
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.522
I need you to be
100% honest with me, OK?

171
00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:55.028
OK, did anybody see you?

172
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:58.766
No. We...we wore
masks and gloves.

173
00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:01.835
OK, good. Uh, did you tell
anybody about this?

174
00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:03.937
No, no, I swear.

175
00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.605
And the car? What about the car?

176
00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.375
I ditched it.
I...I set it on fire.

177
00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.344
Fire? That's smart.

178
00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.413
OK, um... Whose car was it?

179
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.882
Stolen.

180
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.885
OK, then, you're fine.

181
00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:20.888
You're gonna be fine.

182
00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.790
You're gonna...
you're gonna stay here with me.

183
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.025
Right? You're gonna...
you're gonna keep a low profile.

184
00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:28.195
They have absolutely no reason
to think that you would...

185
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.034
-What?

186
00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.568
What?

187
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.538
Ross's phone.

188
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:40.273
What about Ross's cell phone?

189
00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:43.310
I...I...
It's on...it's on him.

190
00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:45.145
It's on him and I forgot.

191
00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:46.814
I just...

192
00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:49.049
It's...it's...

193
00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:53.320
You planned a robbery

194
00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:55.422
on a fucking iPhone?

195
00:10:57.357 --> 00:11:00.227
-Are they gonna go easy on me?
-Are they gonna go easy on you?

196
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.462
TJ, it is an armed robbery
where somebody ends up dead.

197
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.965
TJ, that is 25 to life.

198
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.567
But, you know,
I...I was only the driver.

199
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.636
You were only the driver?
You think that matters to them?

200
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.071
That doesn't matter to them.

201
00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:13.673
And you going to jail,
that breaks my promise to Mom.

202
00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.275
What are we gonna do?

203
00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:21.114
We have to get the phone.

204
00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.784
How?

205
00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.055
Just give me five minutes.

206
00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:36.296
Out here,
regional budgets have been cut

207
00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:38.431
and so the morgue
is pretty much a one-man shop.

208
00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:40.768
And the sheriff's department,
it's overworked, understaffed.

209
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.602
The chief has been cracking down
on local meth-heads.

210
00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.104
According to the news,
about an hour

211
00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:45.472
before they
brought Ross's body in,

212
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:47.474
a girl was killed
when her car hit a tree.

213
00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:50.377
So we know there are at least
2 bodies in there, 1 coroner.

214
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.980
Buys us some time to get inside
and find Ross's phone.

215
00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:56.149
Won't...won't his phone
be with the cops?

216
00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:57.450
Not out here.

217
00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:59.152
Ross and all he had on him

218
00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:00.620
will be processed
at the morgue first.

219
00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:01.955
His clothes, his phone,

220
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:03.156
everything will be
bagged and tagged

221
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.524
and locked in the evidence room

222
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.159
for the sheriff
to claim in the morning,

223
00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:08.295
along with the coroner's
autopsy report.

224
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:11.064
Walk the perimeter,
look for access.

225
00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.901
Yeah, and I'm sure they have
a back door for graverobbers.

226
00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:24.711
Hello?

227
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.881
I...I'm a friend
of the girl who was in the...

228
00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.316
..the car accident tonight.

229
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:31.852
I was hoping that
I could see her

230
00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:34.187
for one last goodbye.

231
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.764
-Oh, fuck!

232
00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.567
-Oh, fucking hell!

233
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.772
Cujo's out back
and there's cameras everywhere.

234
00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:55.075
-Fucking Fort Knox.

235
00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.278
Hello?

236
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.147
This whole place
is locked down.

237
00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:03.583
The only way
we're getting in

238
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.752
is through a fucking
body bag, you know?

239
00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:12.559
-What if that can be arranged?
-Huh? What?

240
00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:15.195
Do you still score Adderall
off that vet tech?

241
00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.130
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it helps me focus.

242
00:13:17.164 --> 00:13:18.798
I need you to call her.

243
00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.337
Hey.

244
00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:27.908
Whoa. Who is this?

245
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:31.811
Oh, this is my...my sister.

246
00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:34.581
She...she's cool, so...

247
00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:36.283
Hey.

248
00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.185
Uh-huh.

249
00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:44.925
-It's 50 for the Addy.
-And the propofol?

250
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.493
Listen, I got it.

251
00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.628
But I need you to understand
that this shit is...

252
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.563
A sterile,
nonpyrogenic emulsion,

253
00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:52.265
full name diisopropylphenyl.

254
00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.466
It's used in the induction

255
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.568
and maintenance
of sedation anaesthesia,

256
00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:58.405
and it works
by dramatically slowing down

257
00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:00.440
the recipient's brain
and nervous system.

258
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:04.044
I study criminology
and forensic medicine.

259
00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:08.148
150.

260
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.017
Come on. No deals today?

261
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.185
Shh. Here.

262
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.357
So I hope y'all know
what y'all doin'.

263
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.160
That shit killed
the King of Pop.

264
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.965
Yeah.

265
00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.500
OK. Now what?

266
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:30.003
Now it's time to die.

267
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.210
How does this,
uh, work exactly?

268
00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:38.645
I inject it.

269
00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:40.180
A few seconds later,
I'll be unconscious.

270
00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.681
The propofol slows
my heart rate

271
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.517
and brain activity
to almost nothing.

272
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.119
I'll still be alive.

273
00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:48.321
I just have a bad feeling
about this, you know?

274
00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:50.958
TJ,
it is after nine o'clock, OK?

275
00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:53.360
By the morning, the sheriff is
going to be in that morgue,

276
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.162
hearing the results
of Ross's autopsy

277
00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:56.663
and collecting his belongings.

278
00:14:56.696 --> 00:14:59.132
How long after that do you think
it is going to take

279
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.701
until you are in custody?

280
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.975
Once I'm unconscious, you're
just gonna wait 30 minutes, OK?

281
00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.709
What? Why?

282
00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.879
Because I have to be cold
when they find me.

283
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.215
Otherwise, they'll...
they'll try to resuscitate.

284
00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:18.885
Look, TJ, you are going
to wait 30 minutes.

285
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.521
You are then going to call 911
and you are going to say

286
00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:23.756
that you saw a girl
OD in the underpass

287
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.425
and that you think
she might be dead,

288
00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.827
but you aren't gonna give
a name or anything.

289
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.496
You understand that?

290
00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:34.201
Yes, but as-assuming
this works,

291
00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.003
how are you gonna get out?

292
00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:39.039
Let's just worry about
getting me in first, yeah?

293
00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:41.708
Look, I, um...
I should do this.

294
00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.011
OK? Look, this was...
this was...

295
00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:45.512
No, no, this was my mess-up.

296
00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:47.214
Alright? Let me fix it.

297
00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:50.417
You have any run-ins
with the local sheriff lately?

298
00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.423
They won't remember me.

299
00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.736
-Hey.

300
00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:11.138
Hey.

301
00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:15.242
You know I love you.

302
00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:17.110
Don't. Don't do that.

303
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.262
OK.

304
00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:38.198
Hey, you alright?

305
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.134
OK, you gotta go.
You gotta get out of here.

306
00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.706
OK.

307
00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:49.442
Love you.

308
00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:50.810
It's alright.

309
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.985
Oh!

310
00:18:58.638 --> 00:18:59.772
OK.

311
00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:02.175
OK.

312
00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:14.187
Oh...

313
00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:17.490
Oh, shit! Sorry.

314
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.442
Oh!

315
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:47.193
Oh, God!

316
00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:04.270
OK.

317
00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:56.222
Shit, shit, shit...

318
00:25:56.255 --> 00:25:57.289
OK.

319
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.689
Hey, you gonna
have Mannix waiting all day?

320
00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:04.056
Come on already.

321
00:27:54.807 --> 00:27:57.910
Yo, I'm here
for the seance.

322
00:27:57.944 --> 00:28:00.847
No? No funnies today?

323
00:28:02.648 --> 00:28:05.451
Man, this is no way
to spend your day.

324
00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:08.120
You got a family,
dinner waiting for you at home?

325
00:28:08.154 --> 00:28:10.322
Or are you too busy breakin'
bread with the dead, huh?

326
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:12.624
Come on, man!

327
00:28:12.658 --> 00:28:14.660
What do you do for
a good time around here?

328
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.362
You got a girl back there
or something?

329
00:28:17.363 --> 00:28:19.832
You know, every time
you hand me one of these,

330
00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:22.368
I feel like we're
going to the beach.

331
00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:24.837
Don't you wish there was
a sixpack in here, huh,

332
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:26.973
some Kool-Aid,
some chicken salad sandwiches?

333
00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:30.042
Ooh, there she is.

334
00:28:30.076 --> 00:28:33.179
Hey! Take it easy.

335
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:35.748
I'm just checking out
the merchandise.

336
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.318
Sheesh!

337
00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:43.322
Oh, shit, I almost forgot.

338
00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:47.626
About that guy in L.A.
looking for the liver?

339
00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.129
Thank God for alcoholic
movie producers, huh?

340
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:54.066
Alright, well, let me know
if that works out

341
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.035
and you might see me
again tonight.

342
00:28:56.068 --> 00:28:58.004
Lucky fuckin' me.

343
00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:44.176
Oh, God.

344
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.949
You stupid asshole.

345
00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:37.863
Ross!

346
00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.465
Hey, hey, hey.

347
00:31:39.498 --> 00:31:41.333
Shh! Shh! Shh!

348
00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:44.070
Shh, shh! Hey. Shh, shh, shh!

349
00:31:44.103 --> 00:31:45.671
Shh, shh!

350
00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:50.242
It's Chloe. It's OK.

351
00:31:50.276 --> 00:31:52.078
-What the...?

352
00:32:02.188 --> 00:32:04.023
Why the hell
are you not in a hospital?

353
00:32:04.056 --> 00:32:05.824
I am.

354
00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.426
Who did this to you?

355
00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:10.029
Was it the...
the guy with the keys?

356
00:32:10.062 --> 00:32:11.530
Was it him? Yeah?

357
00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:13.832
OK, was there anybody else?

358
00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:16.335
Ross, have you seen
anybody else?

359
00:32:20.306 --> 00:32:22.274
What the fuck is going on?

360
00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:25.044
Chloe...

361
00:32:25.077 --> 00:32:27.046
-Shh, shh!
-What are you doing here?

362
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:33.185
You dipshits planned
a robbery on an iPhone.

363
00:32:33.219 --> 00:32:34.786
I know.

364
00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.589
If I don't get it,
then TJ's going to jail.

365
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.393
It's not safe here.

366
00:32:41.427 --> 00:32:42.694
What?

367
00:32:42.728 --> 00:32:46.898
It's not safe here.

368
00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:51.270
OK.

369
00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:54.440
TJ's going to freak out,
he finds out you're alive.

370
00:32:54.473 --> 00:32:56.375
I'm going to get
to the evidence room

371
00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:58.810
and then I'm gonna get you
the hell out of here.

372
00:32:58.844 --> 00:33:00.046
-OK.
-OK, good.

373
00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:01.747
You know where the keys are?

374
00:33:02.748 --> 00:33:04.283
Yeah, I know where they are.

375
00:33:05.517 --> 00:33:07.086
I'll be back.

376
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.914
The order came through

377
00:36:22.948 --> 00:36:24.616
for our man in L.A.

378
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.485
Mannix will be by in an hour.

379
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.512
Ross? OK. Hey!

380
00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:55.647
I need you to get up, OK?

381
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:57.849
Ross? Ross!

382
00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:01.387
OK. Hurry.

383
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.988
I know. Look.

384
00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:05.424
I need you to come with me. OK?

385
00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:07.893
Shit, I'm sorry.

386
00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:10.128
-I'm sorry! Shh, shh!

387
00:37:12.197 --> 00:37:13.665
OK.

388
00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:16.335
I have the keys.

389
00:37:16.368 --> 00:37:19.571
You need to get up
with me right now, OK?

390
00:37:19.605 --> 00:37:20.972
-Come on.

391
00:37:21.006 --> 00:37:23.141
-I know it hurts. Shh! Shh!

392
00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:27.145
OK. I got you.

393
00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.080
Good job. Ready? Almost there.

394
00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:30.349
Just lean onto me.

395
00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:32.384
-I know. Shh, shh!

396
00:37:32.418 --> 00:37:34.820
-I got you...

397
00:37:34.853 --> 00:37:36.254
-OK, you alright?
-Yeah.

398
00:37:36.288 --> 00:37:38.256
-Shh!

399
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.558
-OK?
-Alright.

400
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.860
We need to go.
We need to go, OK?

401
00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:43.529
-I know it hurts.

402
00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:44.896
They cut you.

403
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.165
-Hey, hey.

404
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.035
-Ross.
-Oh!

405
00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.803
Ross, would you look at me?

406
00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:54.706
We have to go.

407
00:37:55.907 --> 00:37:57.443
-Now.
-OK.

408
00:37:57.476 --> 00:38:01.146
-OK? Come on. I got you.
-Fuck!

409
00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:22.968
OK.
You see the door?

410
00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:25.103
We're going to get
through it, OK?

411
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.772
-OK, go. Right there.
-Oh! OK, OK, OK.

412
00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:28.607
OK.

413
00:38:30.742 --> 00:38:31.910
OK.

414
00:38:41.753 --> 00:38:43.054
-Oh, God.

415
00:38:43.088 --> 00:38:45.256
Fuck.

416
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:29.267
Chloe, what did they do to me?

417
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.570
They took your kidney, Ross.

418
00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:35.541
They what?

419
00:39:35.574 --> 00:39:38.644
That's OK, though,
because you have another one.

420
00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:41.146
Son of a bitch.

421
00:39:42.514 --> 00:39:45.116
-Got it. Come on. Right now.

422
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.352
-OK.
-OK. Shh, shh, shh, shh!

423
00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:49.387
OK.

424
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:51.222
-Fuck!
-Shh, shh!

425
00:39:51.256 --> 00:39:52.824
Alright.

426
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:17.048
I'll slow you down.

427
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:18.917
You know you...you just
gotta go, right?

428
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.652
-I'm not leaving.
-What?

429
00:40:20.686 --> 00:40:22.654
When I open this door,
you are going to run.

430
00:40:22.688 --> 00:40:24.422
I still need to get
into the evidence room.

431
00:40:24.456 --> 00:40:26.191
-OK.

432
00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:28.393
OK. Almost there.

433
00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:39.304
-Oh, shit.

434
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.942
He sees us.

435
00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:51.216
-Chloe...
-Shh!

436
00:40:51.249 --> 00:40:52.551
Shit.

437
00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:54.219
He knows we're in here.

438
00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:56.822
-OK.
-Fuck.

439
00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:08.634
OK.

440
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.906
He's coming. He's coming.

441
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.276
Hey, hey, Chloe?
I'm...I'm sorry.

442
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.411
I fucked up.
I'm sorry for all of it.

443
00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:22.581
I will stop him, OK?
You just fuckin' go.

444
00:41:22.614 --> 00:41:24.049
Hey.

445
00:41:24.082 --> 00:41:26.618
You cut the macho shit
right now, OK?

446
00:41:26.652 --> 00:41:29.320
You left me once. You're not
fuckin' doing it again.

447
00:41:32.524 --> 00:41:33.925
OK...

448
00:41:36.962 --> 00:41:39.497
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have ever left.

449
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:41.833
Where is it?
Last key, Ross.

450
00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:43.401
Here we go.

451
00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.003
We're on the last one.

452
00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:48.406
-I got it!

453
00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.641
Ross!

454
00:41:49.675 --> 00:41:51.309
No. Ross.

455
00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:54.279
Hey, I got the door, OK?
I need you to get up.

456
00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:56.281
Come on, come on.
I need you to move.

457
00:41:56.314 --> 00:41:59.284
OK, I need you to come.

458
00:41:59.317 --> 00:42:01.186
Come on.

459
00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:02.788
OK.

460
00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:05.156
Come on, Ross.

461
00:42:27.846 --> 00:42:29.648
Ross...

462
00:42:33.318 --> 00:42:35.921
Ross, Ross...

463
00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:44.329
I doubt
he can hear you.

464
00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:50.869
OK...please,

465
00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:52.671
please, just let us go.

466
00:42:52.704 --> 00:42:54.572
I won't say anything
to anybody, please.

467
00:42:54.606 --> 00:42:56.341
And where would you go?

468
00:42:56.374 --> 00:42:58.877
Back to your
rat-infested apartment?

469
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.879
To your tent city?

470
00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:03.181
To your life of crime?

471
00:43:03.214 --> 00:43:05.250
What? No.

472
00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:09.721
No, that's...that's not me.

473
00:43:09.755 --> 00:43:11.156
Then what are you doing here?

474
00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:13.859
Attempting to claim that
which does not belong to you?

475
00:43:13.892 --> 00:43:15.894
Do you think you're
deserving of it in some way,

476
00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:17.195
that you've earned it?

477
00:43:17.228 --> 00:43:19.831
Compensation for the toils

478
00:43:19.865 --> 00:43:22.100
and petty grievances
that you've accrued

479
00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:24.903
during your time on this Earth?

480
00:43:27.773 --> 00:43:29.775
Maybe you feel like you got
dealt a bad hand

481
00:43:29.808 --> 00:43:30.942
and you should be allowed

482
00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:32.944
to slip a few extra aces
up your sleeve.

483
00:43:32.978 --> 00:43:34.713
You ever considered
getting a job

484
00:43:34.746 --> 00:43:38.083
or is...that completely
out of the question?

485
00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:40.518
This country's filled
with people like you,

486
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:42.520
people who take, take, take.

487
00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:44.522
They don't earn. You cheat.

488
00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.725
You don't strive.
You cut corners.

489
00:43:46.758 --> 00:43:48.626
You take shortcuts.

490
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.529
No, that's not me, though.

491
00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.732
Fortunately for me,

492
00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:58.436
you are all defined
by one undeniable truth.

493
00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.805
All that you are...

494
00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:05.711
..all that you've done,
all of your thoughts,

495
00:44:05.744 --> 00:44:09.147
your feelings, your beliefs...

496
00:44:10.615 --> 00:44:12.984
..your entire being

497
00:44:13.018 --> 00:44:15.520
is worth considerably less...

498
00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:19.490
..than the sum of your parts.

499
00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:23.661
No.

500
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:26.464
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

501
00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:28.299
Please. OK? You're wrong.

502
00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:29.667
I...I am a student

503
00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:31.502
and I know the opportunity
I have been given.

504
00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:34.472
-I wanna make something out...
-What are you studying?

505
00:44:35.707 --> 00:44:38.844
I study...I study...
forensic medicine.

506
00:44:42.814 --> 00:44:44.482
That's an
underappreciated field.

507
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.184
Yeah.

508
00:44:46.217 --> 00:44:47.853
Then you already know
that there are

509
00:44:47.886 --> 00:44:51.322
over a million dollars' worth
of assets inside of you.

510
00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:55.761
Kidney, heart,
liver, lungs, eyes.

511
00:44:55.794 --> 00:44:57.662
That's before we get
into your plasma,

512
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.030
your bone marrow.

513
00:44:59.064 --> 00:45:02.667
Even your skin bears a price.

514
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.170
You should have
valued yourself higher

515
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:07.305
before you broke
into this sacred place.

516
00:45:07.338 --> 00:45:10.141
-I didn't have a choice.
-Of course you had a choice.

517
00:45:10.175 --> 00:45:11.709
Just like he had a choice.

518
00:45:11.743 --> 00:45:13.611
You obviously know
this young man.

519
00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.981
Caught earlier this morning...

520
00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:20.886
..cutting another corner,
taking another shortcut.

521
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.622
Look, I know
what he did was wrong.

522
00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.792
I get that. I'm pissed.

523
00:45:26.825 --> 00:45:30.161
But he...
he does not deserve...

524
00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:31.997
Of course he deserves it.

525
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.833
Who wouldn't vote
to end this wretch's life

526
00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:36.835
if it meant saving
a more worthy person,

527
00:45:36.868 --> 00:45:38.536
a person of value?

528
00:45:41.206 --> 00:45:43.608
You think life
is essentially fair?

529
00:45:46.211 --> 00:45:48.579
Well, unfortunately,
life is not fair.

530
00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:51.582
I know that life isn't fair.

531
00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:54.685
Hey, I know that!
I know that...

532
00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:57.856
-OK.
-And what is your excuse?

533
00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:06.264
My excuse?

534
00:46:07.398 --> 00:46:09.901
My excuse is that
the medical examiner,

535
00:46:09.935 --> 00:46:13.771
he determined my dad's
cause of death as suicide.

536
00:46:13.805 --> 00:46:17.008
But it wasn't suicide.
I know that it wasn't suicide.

537
00:46:17.042 --> 00:46:19.744
He suffered from PTSD,
psychotic episodes

538
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.379
and he was heavily medicated.

539
00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:23.514
And then the insurance,
they cut off his medication...

540
00:46:23.548 --> 00:46:26.284
Ah, suicide cancelled
the insurance policy

541
00:46:26.317 --> 00:46:29.955
and you and Mommy
didn't get any money.

542
00:46:29.988 --> 00:46:31.556
Sad tale.

543
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:33.058
A common one.

544
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:34.860
-A victim's excuse.
-No.

545
00:46:34.893 --> 00:46:37.863
No, I am not
who you think I am, OK?

546
00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:39.297
I got into forensics

547
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.632
because I want to help people
find the truth, like...

548
00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:45.703
The truth is what I say
the truth is.

549
00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:48.439
Your father was a pathetic loser

550
00:46:48.473 --> 00:46:52.110
that did the world a favour
by ending his life.

551
00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:55.981
And you, when you broke in here,
ended your life.

552
00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:01.019
You are a sick man.

553
00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.588
I'm not sick.

554
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:06.124
I'm the cure.

555
00:47:11.997 --> 00:47:15.433
No! No! No!

556
00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:17.468
Please stop!

557
00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:26.044
Please, please, please!

558
00:47:32.317 --> 00:47:34.519
-Oh!

559
00:47:48.666 --> 00:47:51.136
It's OK, it's OK...

560
00:48:15.093 --> 00:48:17.395
-No, no!

561
00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:18.829
No!

562
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.211
Ross...

563
00:48:41.086 --> 00:48:42.520
You know
this used to be

564
00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.255
the largest hospital
in the county?

565
00:48:46.024 --> 00:48:48.626
Now it's just me down here.

566
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:56.367
And I do not like
uninvited guests.

567
00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:33.271
No...

568
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:35.240
Please!

569
00:49:35.273 --> 00:49:36.541
No, please.

570
00:49:36.574 --> 00:49:39.044
Please, I'm sorry!
Please!

571
00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:40.445
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

572
00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:43.814
Shh, shh. It's OK, it's OK.

573
00:49:43.848 --> 00:49:45.316
Listen, listen, listen.

574
00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.153
Not one word.

575
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:53.891
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, Dad.

576
00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.760
Mom wants to know
if you're coming home tonight.

577
00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:59.097
Oh, no, honey, I can't make it.
Daddy's working.

578
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.931
Oh. We miss you.

579
00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:02.600
I miss you too.

580
00:50:02.633 --> 00:50:04.569
I'll see you
for breakfast tomorrow.

581
00:50:04.602 --> 00:50:06.804
Don't forget to call Brad
before school.

582
00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.439
I won't.

583
00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:09.607
Love you.

584
00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:12.177
Love you too.

585
00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:27.492
I don't know what you want.
I'm sorry. I'm...

586
00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:29.127
Thank you for that.

587
00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:34.199
Know that his death and yours

588
00:50:34.232 --> 00:50:37.135
will bring renewed life
to someone who's willing

589
00:50:37.168 --> 00:50:40.037
to sacrifice everything
for their beliefs

590
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:41.839
and now, thanks to me,

591
00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.875
your trivial existence
will have meaning.

592
00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:47.044
I'm going to give your
life worth,

593
00:50:47.078 --> 00:50:50.381
piece by piece...

594
00:50:50.415 --> 00:50:52.350
..by piece.

595
00:50:59.557 --> 00:51:00.725
No...

596
00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:10.561
OK, OK, OK.

597
00:52:13.764 --> 00:52:16.334
OK. OK.

598
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.676
I'm sorry, sorry.

599
00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:30.715
I'm sorry.

600
00:52:30.748 --> 00:52:32.517
OK. Alright.

601
00:52:33.518 --> 00:52:34.952
Yes.

602
00:52:37.288 --> 00:52:39.957
OK.

603
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:47.632
OK.

604
00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:02.280
Come on. Please.

605
00:53:05.383 --> 00:53:06.951
Come on.

606
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:37.975
Ahh!

607
00:59:04.575 --> 00:59:05.910
Eight...

608
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.779
Give it to me.

609
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.349
This is what this is all about?

610
01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.452
Some dead loser's cell phone?

611
01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.289
Just give me the fucking phone.

612
01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:03.460
You know, for someone who's
a scholar of forensic science,

613
01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.163
you should know a little more
about protocol procedure.

614
01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:10.267
We would never leave
a live firearm unattended...

615
01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:15.505
..which means that gun
is either unloaded...

616
01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:19.043
..or it's fake.

617
01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:27.117
-Give it to me!

618
01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:28.585
Oh!

619
01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:41.966
No... No!

620
01:01:42.967 --> 01:01:44.201
Damn!

621
01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.148
-Sorry...

622
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.283
Help me.

623
01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:15.986
Please.

624
01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.222
I'm sorry.

625
01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:22.659
-Oh! Ah!

626
01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:32.702
-Shh, shh, shh!

627
01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:43.580
Oh, my God.

628
01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.319
Chloe.

629
01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:50.887
Can you hear me?

630
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.423
Up here.

631
01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.893
I assume TJ is your brother.

632
01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.031
Naughty little boy, isn't he?

633
01:05:01.065 --> 01:05:03.500
In literature,
they refer to him

634
01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.402
as an irredeemable character,

635
01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:07.037
loathsome.

636
01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:09.606
I'm sure you disagree.

637
01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:13.210
I can tell
he's had his problems.

638
01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.379
Probably renders him
sympathetic in your view.

639
01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.481
But to me,
he's just a pile of dog shit

640
01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:18.915
on a pristine carpet

641
01:05:18.949 --> 01:05:20.250
and tarnishing the environment

642
01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:21.851
for those of us
that are hard-working,

643
01:05:21.885 --> 01:05:23.653
those of us
that are law-abiding

644
01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:24.821
and those of us

645
01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.756
that contribute.

646
01:05:32.196 --> 01:05:34.098
Luckily, the cell phone

647
01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:36.866
you've risked so much for
holds the key

648
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.204
that will imprison
your feeble-minded brother

649
01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:43.440
for what's left
of his worthless life.

650
01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.742
You know what they call
someone like TJ in prison,

651
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.277
Chloe?

652
01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:49.913
They call them "June bugs".

653
01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.349
Do you know why
they call them June bugs?

654
01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.252
Because they only live
for six months.

655
01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:03.227
But I believe you sought
to better your life.

656
01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:09.433
But your delinquent brother
pulled you back into this world

657
01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.768
and now you are one step away

658
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.670
from Ross's fate.

659
01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.844
Turn yourself in to me
now, Chloe.

660
01:06:51.275 --> 01:06:55.412
Here she is.
Yes. Go find her.

661
01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.007
Hello?

662
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.575
TJ?

663
01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.178
Oh, Chloe, where are you?

664
01:07:28.212 --> 01:07:29.779
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

665
01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:33.183
I'm...I'm still inside.

666
01:07:33.217 --> 01:07:35.385
Are you alright?

667
01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:36.720
TJ...

668
01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:39.456
Look, they, uh...

669
01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:42.726
..they hurt people here.

670
01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:45.329
OK, wh-what do you mean?

671
01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.567
I don't know. It's really
hard to explain right now.

672
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.536
-Chloe...
-TJ, I...

673
01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.472
I think I failed you.
I'm so sorry.

674
01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:58.208
I can't get your phone.
I tried really hard.

675
01:07:58.242 --> 01:07:59.776
I promise.

676
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.713
-Are you in danger?
-No, you don't worry about me.

677
01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:06.316
I need you to get
the hell out of this state.

678
01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.684
Chloe, I'm not
leaving the state.

679
01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:10.787
I am not asking you
right now, OK? I...

680
01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.592
Look, I couldn't save Mom.

681
01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:19.763
I couldn't help Dad,
and I am not being the one

682
01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:22.266
to lose you too,
so I need you to listen to me.

683
01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:24.868
I'm not leaving you.
Chloe, just stay where you are.

684
01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:27.171
TJ, now, you listen to me
right now.

685
01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:30.774
TJ?

686
01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:32.376
Hello?

687
01:08:37.547 --> 01:08:39.115
I had to cut the line.

688
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.651
Can't have you making
outgoing calls.

689
01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:44.254
-Don't worry about him.

690
01:08:44.288 --> 01:08:45.922
He's a good boy.

691
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.993
He's trained to maim
and detain, not kill.

692
01:09:10.614 --> 01:09:12.216
Hi.

693
01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:15.585
Yeah, um, I'd like to speak
to the sheriff.

694
01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:46.916
Sheriff.

695
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:49.819
Well, if it ain't TJ Albright.

696
01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:51.988
What can I do for you
this fine evening?

697
01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:54.991
I'll, uh...I'll...

698
01:09:57.627 --> 01:09:59.128
..I'll confess.

699
01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:02.299
I just, um... I need you
to do something for me first.

700
01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:04.334
What's that?

701
01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.371
I need you to save my sister.

702
01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:11.408
Oh, shit.

703
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.724
Alright.

704
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.926
You want it? You like this?

705
01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.928
-OK, OK.

706
01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:06.596
OK, OK!

707
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.353
TJ.

708
01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.540
Slow down there, tiger.

709
01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.780
Oh, God! Oh! Sheriff!

710
01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:33.316
We need to...we need
to go outside right now.

711
01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.519
-Miss Chloe Albright.
-Don't...

712
01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:37.954
TJ here was bullshitting me.

713
01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:42.459
Ooh... It's OK, TJ.

714
01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:45.028
What in Christ's name
is going on?

715
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.531
OK, um...

716
01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:49.599
OK, look, the coroner,

717
01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:52.636
OK, he...he's...he's keeping
people alive, OK?

718
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:54.270
He is selling...
he is selling their organs

719
01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.540
and bits and parts of them

720
01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:59.208
and I think he has killed
a lot of people.

721
01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:01.478
That's quite an accusation
this late on a Friday.

722
01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:04.481
You need to get in there, OK?
I saw him. I saw him.

723
01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:11.788
It's OK.

724
01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:15.792
Sheriff, he murdered somebody

725
01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:17.894
right in front of me.

726
01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:19.829
Come on.

727
01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.898
I never liked this coroner.

728
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:23.800
Old-timer before him,
he was easy.

729
01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:26.035
This guy's
a pretentious nightmare.

730
01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.370
Yeah, yeah.

731
01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:30.173
If he's the psycho
you say he is,

732
01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:32.208
I'm looking forward to being

733
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:35.011
the swift boot of justice
up his ass.

734
01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:37.914
Tell you what.

735
01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.415
You two stay put

736
01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:41.751
while I go see what's what.

737
01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:43.152
OK, OK.

738
01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:45.922
But, Sheriff,
you need to be careful.

739
01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.758
I'm telling you,
he's dangerous.

740
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:50.894
OK.

741
01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:54.564
Thank you. TJ...

742
01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:55.565
Oh!

743
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.668
What the fuck?!

744
01:13:58.702 --> 01:14:01.037
TJ, TJ, just run! TJ!

745
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.740
Dangerous, huh? Well, so am I.

746
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.408
Get...

747
01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.712
No!

748
01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:10.413
-Mm-mm, no.
-No, no, no!

749
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.381
-Oh!

750
01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:14.117
Oh! TJ!

751
01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.725
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

752
01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.593
..shut the fuck up!

753
01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:25.629
-Whoa...
-Let's go.

754
01:14:25.662 --> 01:14:29.298
-OK...
-Get the fuck away from him!

755
01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:34.237
Hey, now.

756
01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.607
Let's not be hasty.

757
01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:40.810
Is that Ross's gun?

758
01:14:42.111 --> 01:14:43.947
Put the gun on the ground,
Miss Albright.

759
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.350
TJ, TJ, get behind me right now.

760
01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:50.620
Chloe, we should just
do what he says.

761
01:14:50.654 --> 01:14:52.121
No.

762
01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:54.157
No, we are walking out of here.

763
01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.825
Don't make me kill you.

764
01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.261
You wouldn't...

765
01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.730
..because we're more
valuable to you alive.

766
01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:02.131
Right?

767
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.903
Yeah.

768
01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.138
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

769
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.182
The gun is fake.

770
01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:24.688
The gun is fake.

771
01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:27.991
Shit.

772
01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:33.162
Now...

773
01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:36.800
..this one is real.

774
01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.502
Changes your odds of survival
a little bit, now, don't it?

775
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.571
Oh, TJ...

776
01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:45.642
I want them alive.

777
01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:48.712
Oh, come on, man! You serious?

778
01:15:48.745 --> 01:15:50.113
-I just...
-Hyah!

779
01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.515
-Oh!
-Move! Run, TJ!

780
01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:56.085
Go!

781
01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:05.061
TJ, the gate! TJ!

782
01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:09.532
-We're trapped...
-No, no, no, that's not good.

783
01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.400
That's not good.
That's not good.

784
01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.332
Bad...dog.

785
01:16:45.735 --> 01:16:47.704
-Come on.
-OK.

786
01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.205
Shit! Go!

787
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.800
That-a-boy, Mac.
Burn 'em down.

788
01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.539
Go!

789
01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:28.812
Let's go. Go.
Just go. Go! Go, go!

790
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.350
Fuck.

791
01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:51.801
TJ?

792
01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.671
TJ?!

793
01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:58.507
TJ!

794
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.288
-Shit! No! Chloe!

795
01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:16.492
Chloe! Fuck!

796
01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.198
Chloe!

797
01:18:23.566 --> 01:18:24.801
TJ!

798
01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:26.770
Let me go!

799
01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.004
Chloe!

800
01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.216
-Chloe!

801
01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:42.151
-Get off!
-Chloe!

802
01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:44.653
Get off me! Get off me!

803
01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:49.558
-Get off of him! Get off of him!

804
01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:51.861
Get off of him! Get off!

805
01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.298
Come on, get him off!
Get him off!

806
01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:00.136
Get him off! Get him off!

807
01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:25.528
TJ? TJ?

808
01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.599
-You have to get up.
-No, I need a minute, OK? No.

809
01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:36.205
Come on. You've got to get up.

810
01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:37.506
You've got to get up.

811
01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:45.448
Slow down, down.
Fuck. Alright.

812
01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.550
OK, we're trapped.

813
01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:51.220
OK.

814
01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:54.891
OK, it's locked.
We got to break in.

815
01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:56.960
Look on the ground, OK?

816
01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:01.898
-This will work.
-Yeah.

817
01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.066
OK, OK.

818
01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:04.767
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

819
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.569
-I need you to twist it.
-I know.

820
01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:10.573
-One, two...
-Come on.

821
01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:13.542
-OK, that's it.
-Yep, go.

822
01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:16.245
-OK, OK.

823
01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:39.802
You OK, bud?

824
01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.537
They rattle your brain?

825
01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:52.115
Where are they?

826
01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:55.618
They went down there.

827
01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:57.853
Keep 'em there
till we can drive them to us.

828
01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:01.657
-How?
-Smoke 'em out.

829
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.292
Tear gas in my car.

830
01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.331
What the fuck is that?

831
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.266
Mannix.

832
01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:11.400
Shit!

833
01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:14.737
No-one's supposed to know
about me, remember?

834
01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.184
TJ.

835
01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.519
Come here. Come here.

836
01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.288
-OK? It's OK.
-I'm so sorry, Chloe.

837
01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:34.057
-No.
-I'm sorry.

838
01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:36.692
It's OK. It's OK.

839
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:40.029
-You're OK.
-I'm sorry, Chloe.

840
01:21:40.063 --> 01:21:41.397
Hey.

841
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.966
It is going to be OK.

842
01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:44.200
-Shh!
-No, it's not.

843
01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.801
-No, we're trapped.
-Look at me.

844
01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:47.937
There is going to be
a way out of here.

845
01:21:49.272 --> 01:21:51.007
You need to trust me.

846
01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.641
-Yeah, OK.
-OK.

847
01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:54.310
-We're a team.
-Yeah, I know.

848
01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:55.979
Come on.

849
01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:05.654
"Wow, look at me.

850
01:22:05.688 --> 01:22:07.056
"I'm the coroner. I got keys."

851
01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.325
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, open up the door.

852
01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.402
What's the deal?

853
01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.104
You're not gonna
let me in this time?

854
01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:24.140
There's been a situation
with the liver.

855
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.246
-I lost it.
-What?

856
01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.348
What the fuck, man?
That puts us down 100 grand.

857
01:22:32.381 --> 01:22:34.883
I'm in the process
of replacing it.

858
01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:37.053
I need you to come back
in an hour.

859
01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:40.589
What the fuck
is up with your eye?

860
01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.394
Why did you change
this shit up on me?

861
01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:48.397
You know Mannix is
a creature of habit.

862
01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:50.566
You're making me nervous.

863
01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:53.736
I'm starting to sweat in places
you don't wanna hear about.

864
01:22:57.673 --> 01:22:59.975
What the fuck?
Is that a cop car?

865
01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:01.277
What if he sees me?

866
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.918
Oh, shit!
You sly motherfucker, you.

867
01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:12.155
You got a pig
working for you, don't you?

868
01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:14.090
That's how you get
the live ones.

869
01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:16.459
Me and Chase,
the pick-up guy in Lancaster,

870
01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.394
we was wondering about that.

871
01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:22.565
Fuck, now I owe him 50 bucks.
I knew I smelled bacon.

872
01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.300
So where is he?
Can I meet him?

873
01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.768
Or her. I'm down
with either one.

874
01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:27.270
We're all part of the
same team, right?

875
01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:28.804
It's... What?

876
01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.606
Ugh!

877
01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:33.109
Gunshot.

878
01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.778
Oh, God. Who's shooting who?

879
01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:38.747
It doesn't matter. OK.

880
01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:40.149
Come on.

881
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:43.119
Motherfucker!

882
01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:46.255
What?

883
01:23:46.289 --> 01:23:48.491
You just cost us $100,000.

884
01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:49.992
He had a big mouth.

885
01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.527
Shame we can't sell that.

886
01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.229
We would have raised
a pretty penny.

887
01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:06.075
Ow!

888
01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.688
-TJ.
-What?

889
01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:21.524
Over here.

890
01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:29.031
-Move this?
-Yeah.

891
01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.067
Shh!

892
01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:33.869
Shh! Shh!

893
01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:36.505
OK.

894
01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:40.042
-Can we get through?
-Yeah, yeah, we can.

895
01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.245
Shh! Shh!

896
01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:43.846
OK.

897
01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.728
-You OK?
-Yeah, there's just some pipe.

898
01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:02.131
-Watch it.
-OK.

899
01:25:14.277 --> 01:25:16.179
Shh, shh, shh.

900
01:25:24.587 --> 01:25:27.590
You shot our contact.
You, Sheriff, have fucked us.

901
01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.725
Not the way
I see it, partner.

902
01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:32.628
This guy was shot
by some intruder.

903
01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:34.597
The same punks
locked in the basement.

904
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.632
They killed him, not us.

905
01:25:36.665 --> 01:25:38.801
Can't we just hand over
his liver?

906
01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:49.812
I don't think they'll accept
a liver with buckshot, do you?

907
01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:53.882
OK. How about the ones
you keep in reserve downstairs?

908
01:25:53.916 --> 01:25:56.719
Spare parts
from drunks, junkies.

909
01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:58.954
Kidneys are OK, eyes are good,

910
01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.290
but livers are rotten.

911
01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:03.859
How about yours?

912
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:07.062
Don't even joke.

913
01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.997
You so much as raise
an eyebrow at me

914
01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:11.634
and I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

915
01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:16.104
And what story will you tell?

916
01:26:16.138 --> 01:26:17.806
Any one I want.

917
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.844
I'll be a goddamn hero,
stopping the Calexico Butcher.

918
01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:24.012
Might even get a parade.

919
01:26:26.549 --> 01:26:28.684
Squirrelly SOB, ain't he?

920
01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:38.327
I'll make the call.

921
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.496
I'll tell them there's
been a slight hiccup...

922
01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.599
..but there's
a solution in play.

923
01:26:43.632 --> 01:26:45.200
What about him?

924
01:26:45.234 --> 01:26:46.869
Get the tear gas.

925
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.805
We need a liver.

926
01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:06.722
I have the item
you requested on hand.

927
01:27:06.755 --> 01:27:08.691
But you'll need a new courier.

928
01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:11.059
Drive it yourself.

929
01:27:11.093 --> 01:27:15.063
Transfer me an extra 50.
Your rush is not my problem.

930
01:27:23.105 --> 01:27:24.907
I'm sorry, TJ.

931
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.041
No, no. He's gone.

932
01:27:31.213 --> 01:27:34.550
Your man getting blindsided
is not my fault.

933
01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:38.521
Misfortune is remedied
by ingenuity.

934
01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:42.391
And money.

935
01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:44.327
Deliver in two hours.

936
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.362
You'll have your extra.

937
01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:47.930
Don't be late.

938
01:27:52.535 --> 01:27:54.603
Rats in the walls.

939
01:28:16.392 --> 01:28:18.427
Grab his legs.
Grab his legs.

940
01:28:20.996 --> 01:28:23.466
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.
-Shh, shh, shh!

941
01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:25.300
He's...he's bleeding
all over the place.

942
01:28:25.334 --> 01:28:26.769
Who the hell
are you guys?

943
01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.471
No-one. OK, OK, good.

944
01:28:28.504 --> 01:28:30.105
Well, you just
saved my ass back there,

945
01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.774
so that's got
to make you somebody.

946
01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.542
OK,
this is gonna hurt.

947
01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:36.745
-Sorry! Shh, shh, shh!

948
01:28:36.779 --> 01:28:38.313
I'm sorry.

949
01:28:38.347 --> 01:28:41.650
Get me the hell out of here, I
got 10 G's with your name on it.

950
01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:44.052
-Make it 25.
-TJ.

951
01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:45.621
Our enemy's enemy has money.

952
01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:48.557
We need it, he needs us. Right?

953
01:28:48.591 --> 01:28:50.125
I don't know. I can't think.

954
01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.961
Done. But Mannix can't be dead.

955
01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:56.765
The fuck?

956
01:28:58.367 --> 01:28:59.668
Tear gas.

957
01:28:59.702 --> 01:29:01.937
OK, uh, TJ?

958
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:03.772
I need you to focus, OK?
Focus. Get back...

959
01:29:13.516 --> 01:29:15.818
OK, look at me.
OK, you need to put this on.

960
01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.687
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Breathe. Breathe.

961
01:29:18.721 --> 01:29:20.956
They're going to come
after me, OK?

962
01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:22.691
You take him,
you go where it's safe

963
01:29:22.725 --> 01:29:25.093
and then you wait and then
you get the fuckin' money.

964
01:29:25.127 --> 01:29:26.995
-No, no. Wait, wait...
-Listen to him, OK?

965
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:29.264
I'm gonna be fine.
You go. Go, go, go, go.

966
01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.699
OK, OK.

967
01:29:30.733 --> 01:29:32.835
Go, go. There, under.

968
01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:34.503
You follow him, OK?

969
01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.074
Oh, fuck!

970
01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:45.107
-Dammit!

971
01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.609
God!

972
01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:50.412
Alright.

973
01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.381
OK.

974
01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.942
-OK.

975
01:31:19.975 --> 01:31:22.444
Shh! Shh! Shh!

976
01:31:23.946 --> 01:31:25.047
Go, go.

977
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.182
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

978
01:32:09.057 --> 01:32:10.726
I got her!

979
01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:17.299
Nowhere to run, baby.

980
01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:20.969
Drop the hammer.

981
01:32:23.739 --> 01:32:25.207
Ugh!

982
01:33:24.232 --> 01:33:25.600
Shit.

983
01:33:36.779 --> 01:33:39.281
Your sister owes me a liver.

984
01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:41.116
Yours will do.

985
01:33:57.499 --> 01:33:59.101
Chloe?

986
01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:02.304
You have completely
ruined my life.

987
01:34:03.672 --> 01:34:05.407
I can explain a lot of things,

988
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.743
but a dead sheriff
is not one of them.

989
01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:12.781
Looks like I'll have to move on.

990
01:34:15.017 --> 01:34:17.385
But before I do,

991
01:34:17.419 --> 01:34:19.287
you should know

992
01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:22.157
that this pathetic life
of your brother's...

993
01:34:23.759 --> 01:34:27.395
..will bring renewed life
to three, maybe even four

994
01:34:27.429 --> 01:34:29.932
more worthy people.

995
01:34:31.366 --> 01:34:33.969
And once he's donated
to the deserving...

996
01:34:49.384 --> 01:34:51.119
..it will be your turn.

997
01:35:22.384 --> 01:35:23.585
TJ?

998
01:35:25.187 --> 01:35:27.823
TJ. Hey.

999
01:35:29.925 --> 01:35:31.693
Hi. Hi.

1000
01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.661
It's gonna be OK, OK?

1001
01:35:33.695 --> 01:35:35.330
I got you.

1002
01:35:35.363 --> 01:35:37.833
-Behind you...
-What? What?

1003
01:35:37.866 --> 01:35:39.501
Behind you.

1004
01:35:39.534 --> 01:35:40.836
Hi.

1005
01:35:45.774 --> 01:35:47.976
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

1006
01:35:48.010 --> 01:35:49.544
An eye...

1007
01:35:50.779 --> 01:35:52.247
..for an eye.

1008
01:35:53.949 --> 01:35:56.351
No...

1009
01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:19.507
Oh, holy shit.

1010
01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:10.358
It's my turn now.

1011
01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:35.750
Huh!

1012
01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:37.986
Arggh! Arggh!

1013
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:43.725
Take it!

1014
01:37:56.905 --> 01:37:59.207
You are the sickness.

1015
01:38:00.508 --> 01:38:02.310
I'm the cure.

1016
01:39:16.151 --> 01:39:17.419
I'm OK.

1017
01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:19.787
OK, w-w-we saved you, so...

1018
01:39:19.821 --> 01:39:22.290
..you know, you...

1019
01:39:22.324 --> 01:39:23.625
..you gotta pay.

1020
01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:26.728
I saved you back, so...

1021
01:39:26.761 --> 01:39:28.596
..seems like we're even.

1022
01:39:30.632 --> 01:39:32.134
That's bullshit.

1023
01:39:35.737 --> 01:39:37.072
I still need something.

1024
01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:39.641
You get it for me...

1025
01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:42.477
..I pay you in full.

1026
01:39:52.587 --> 01:39:53.755
God, I hate that damn dog.

1027
01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:55.990
Dr Death killed his reserves.

1028
01:39:56.024 --> 01:39:58.060
No loose ends, I guess.

1029
01:39:58.093 --> 01:40:01.129
Not that it matters now,
you arrogant fuck.

1030
01:40:01.163 --> 01:40:03.131
Mannix is a bad dude,

1031
01:40:03.165 --> 01:40:05.067
but that motherfucker,

1032
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.002
he's gonna be the devil's bitch
for sure.

1033
01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:12.607
OK.

1034
01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.842
OK, she's done.

1035
01:40:14.876 --> 01:40:16.111
Pay up.

1036
01:40:21.116 --> 01:40:23.151
A deal's a deal, my man.

1037
01:40:51.246 --> 01:40:52.647
Nice shirt, man.

1038
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.881
Huh!

1039
01:40:53.915 --> 01:40:56.184
Hey, you good?

1040
01:40:56.218 --> 01:40:57.852
Yeah, I'm better than ever.

1041
01:41:01.156 --> 01:41:02.890
You need a ride?

1042
01:41:02.924 --> 01:41:04.892
You need a doctor.

1043
01:41:04.926 --> 01:41:06.861
There's one where I'm going.

1044
01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.430
Close enough.

1045
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:12.200
So can I drop
you two off or what?

1046
01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:17.239
Yeah.

1047
01:41:17.272 --> 01:41:19.741
-Alright.
-You can drop us off.

1048
01:41:25.747 --> 01:41:28.216
-Oh, hey, uh...

1049
01:41:29.217 --> 01:41:32.287
I almost forgot
to give this to you.

1050
01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:41.963
-Ready to get outta here?
-Fuck, yeah.

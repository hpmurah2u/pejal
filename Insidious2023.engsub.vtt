00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:20.210


2
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.210
Are you ready?

3
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.830
.ready

4
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050
.ready to forget forever

5
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270
Good, Mr. Lambert

6
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.520
So, close your eyes

7
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.150
.both of you

8
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.670
.and take a deep breath

9
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.420
Now you will start to feel more and more refreshed

10
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610
Neither of you will remember last year

11
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.750
There is no place called "the isthmus."

12
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.220
You'll only remember Dalton's coma

13
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.440
.and his recovery

14
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.720
..and let the darkness go away

15
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.960
.more and more

16
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.300
"Nine years later"

17
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.160
There is a time for everything, and for every matter
time under the heavens

18
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.130
time to give birth

19
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.100
And there is time to die

20
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.210
, to kill time

21
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.080
.and to heal time

22
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.040
maintenance time

23
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.540
And there is time to ask

24
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.910
Crying time

25
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.110
Time to laugh

26
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.840
A time to mourn, and a time to dance

27
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.730
Time to be silent

28
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.940
And to talk time

29
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.810
, to love time

30
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.380
Hatred has a time

31
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.490
There is a time for war and a time for peace

32
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.770
.Amen

33
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.180
.Amen

34
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.140
We deliver this body to Earth

35
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.250
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes

36
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.260
"we remember you with love"

37
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.520
.and dirt to dirt. Amen

38
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.900
It was a beautiful requiem for a beautiful grandmother

39
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.750
She loved you so much

40
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.720
Your mom was a great friend, Josh
Thank you

41
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.800
.I miss my grandmother

42
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.810
She misses you, too, Callie

43
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.900
The dead do not long for anything

44
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.100
Well, that's not true
.and she misses you

45
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.030
See you next weekend, okay?

46
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.860
.(Dalton)

47
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.780
(Dalton)

48
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.150
do you understand what I mean?

49
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.310
He's just nervous about leaving

50
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.200
.to the collage. next week

51
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.670
.Know

52
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.040
.yeah, no

53
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.590
Thanks for organizing this

54
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.130
I'm just in a bad mood

55
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.800
How about you take him to college?

56
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.050
You have a few weeks before your students come

57
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.700
No, he wouldn't want me to
It's not the father, it's you

58
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.380
If you don't want to, that's another thing
.I can't

59
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.800
Why?

60
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.450
.it was just an idea

61
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.180
Maybe let's see if there is a way
.to reconnect with you, that's it

62
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.410
..you know, he's leaving soon, so...

63
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.140
.finally. think about it

64
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.680
.Farewell. I'll see you later

65
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.860
.Excuse me

66
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.380
.Excuse me. hey

67
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.450
do I know you?

68
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.000
.I knew your mother

69
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.930
.. years ago

70
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.960
But our communication was cut off

71
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.980
What is your name

72
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.180
(Carl)

73
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.810
Nice to meet you, Carl

74
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.800
I appreciate you coming to the funeral
I apologize for stopping you

75
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.940
.I'm confused
.of course

76
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.490
Death floods the mind with memories

77
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.120
But one should always
Makes new memories, right?

78
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.560
.Okay

79
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.630

"Hey mate, I had an idea."

83

What if I take you to school?
"next week?

Okay?

88
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.810
You know, let's do something

89
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.950
..we can clean those diapers

90
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.720
And re-wear the same nappy

91
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.020

92
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.610

are you hungry

112
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.820
You should get rid of that face
Pout, otherwise it will be a long day

113
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.090
"Mom: How are things?"

114
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.960
"terrible"

115
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.600
."fine"

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.450
Your mom said you got a teacher

117
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.350

"Kappa Tau"? You are the Kappa Z fraternity.

129
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.450
It's been a long time, of course

130
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.090
.I'll take one for him. Thanks

131
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.490

Pick your bed

135
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.380
Your mom packed you a power source

136
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.820
What's wrong with this?
.."Two plugs", "USB" port

137
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.710
Two connecting wires

138
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.460
.which is useless

139
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.070
.she is ready

140
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.280
.Good

141
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.950
Do you still need this?

142
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.180
My mom packed it in the bag

143
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.090
.she is intense
Is this what you were drawing?

144
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.450
Put it back in place
No, it's a great drawing

145
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.070
Did you draw it from memory?

146
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.910
.It's one of the pictures I found at home

147
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.330
Wow, it looks like it is

148
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.610
As if she's hiding something?

149
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.490
..this is what I feel

150
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.020
.what I feel in recent years

151
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.740
She had a hard life
.being a single mother

152
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.090
.yeah, that's hard

153
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.390
Shouldn't you put my picture
On the wall?

154
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.620
.I do not blame you

155
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.320
.sorry for being absent lately

156
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.350
..of course dad wasn't around but

157
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.860
.It could be worse

158
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.110
..I was a bit

159
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.180
Confused in the few years
..past, as if the brain

160
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.200
..that I just

161
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.720
..I managed

162
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.080
Allocate sufficient time for you and your two sisters

163
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.610
Have you thought about asking for help?

164
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.230
.I'm trying to move forward on my own

165
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.620
Are you Dalton Lambert?
Yes, were you...?

166
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.000
(Chris Winslow)

167
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.640
Is everything okay?
Yeah, no, everything's fine

168
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.100
But I thought my buddy
..with housing it will be

169
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.810
.boy

170
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.170
.Okay

171
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.500
I think it's a liberal arts college
Focusing on the word "liberal".

172
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.990
Yes, the name Chris confused me

173
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.910
correct. This will not happen with
A name like Dalton

174
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.530
You know, I'm going to an office
.dormitory and solve this

175
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.330
No, no, please, Father Dalton

176
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.370
.excuse me..
I interrupted his male cohabitation

177
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.180
.I will be right back

178
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.280

.check it out

181
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.550
..it's okay if you hate it but you

182
00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.180
.you won't hate it

183
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.330
You don't really know me, do you?

184
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.630
I mean, do you think I'm interested in a frat bond?

185
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.700
It's just a party, Dalton

186
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.220
.Go. I listen

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.330
.do it for. I brought you here

188
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.280
You didn't even want to
Of course I did

189
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.490
Stop lying to me!

190
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.690
.I heard my mom at the funeral

191
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:57.940
.I still did it

192
00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.800
So you are now father of the year?

193
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.300
At least you have a father

194
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.350
Don't blame your father for your mistakes

195
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.270
He dumped you 40 years ago
.get over this now

196
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.870
.I will not be like you

197
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.870
are you kidding me? After all we've done for you?

198
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.400
When did you become so ungrateful?

199
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.460
No wonder my mother divorced you

200
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.890
Thanks for the ride

201
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.340
You can hear that this is Shine Twain, right?

202
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.880
.Okay

203
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.930
So what did they say about housing?

204
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.670
What a pity, they said

205
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.340
.I have to sleep here tonight

206
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.530
But tomorrow they will give me a room
.others, so this is not a permanent situation

207
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.860
.Do not complain

208
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.280
I assume you are studying art here
Yes. And you? the music?

209
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.210
.mathematics

210
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.380
I wanted music, but the life of an artist
Unstable and full of anguish

211
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.720
But I am sure you will be very successful

212
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.070
Would you like to blow with my instrument?
What?

213
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.680
can you play

214
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.410
.I can play the piano a little bit

215
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.330
.it's the same thing. Just blow

216
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.100
My germs are harmless

217
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.470
What is this?

218
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.510
.something my mom made

219
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080
.Beautiful

220
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.030
..permission

221
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.110
What is the strangest thing about you?

222
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.630
.I don't know

223
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400
.I don't know

224
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.820
Come on, dude, everybody's a stranger

225
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:31.740
.You first

226
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.060
On Sundays I wear monocles
.eye and ask for food with a British accent

227
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.070
.It's weird

228
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.980
.Thanks

229
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.900
Well, sometimes eat

230
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.860
Instant oatmeal

231
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.110
.without water or milk or the like

232
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.290
.This will be dry

233
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.840
How awful you are in this

234
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.740
Let's try again

235
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.540
When I was 10 years old he died
My parents and I went to my grandmother Berky

236
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.310
who once almost lost her sight
Because of a bad case of tinea pedis

237
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.810
I don't remember when I was 10 years old

238
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.840
.I mean throughout that year

239
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.030
What do you mean?

240
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.070
.I was in a coma

241
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.990
Viral meningitis

242
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.790
At least that's what they told me many times
.the few that talked about it

243
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.810
But I don't remember anything

244
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.970
.not even being sick

245
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.530
As if I woke up one day
And a whole year has passed

246
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.030
.that's horrible

247
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.710
.and very rarely

248
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.830
.Done well

249
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.350
Yeah, actually I wish I was
I forgot a whole year when I was a kid

250
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.290
.I could have benefited from meningitis

251
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.620
..you know, there

252
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.600
Another strange thing about me

253
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.400
..since you were in coma

254
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.660
.I am afraid of the dark

255
00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.880
..I was even afraid of Barbie dolls

256
00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.560
.now

257
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.410
There is nothing wrong with being afraid

258
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.280
As long as you keep the lights on
You won't be able to sleep

259
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.050
Seriously?
.sorry

260
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.740
.Well whatever

261
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.070
.decent. I will bear

262
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.700
Hi, I'm Dalton

263
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.330
.I can't answer you now
So leave a message and I will get back to you

264
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.450
.hi dude, it's me

265
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.950
I called to check on your coping
.with the new location

266
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.160
..I just thought about what you said

267
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480
..And

268
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.790
..I don't know

269
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.900
..what's wrong with me but

270
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.450
.I'll make it clear

271
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.360
.I just wanted you to know that

272
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:08.740
.Good. Farewell

273
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:36.380
.Welcome

274
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.470
I'm Professor Armaghan

275
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.960
Turn off your phones

276
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.020
Open the graphics bags

277
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.020
.Draw something that might interest me

278
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.890
.Put it on the stand

279
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.970
Stand by your work

280
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.890
.Stand proud

281
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.450
(Alec Anderson)

282
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.660
Your style is clear

283
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.220
.look like a picture

284
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.340
.Thanks

285
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.020
.that was not flattery

286
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.590
.rip it

287
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.840
Excuse me?

288
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.810
.graph. rip it

289
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.070
I put a lot of effort into this drawing

290
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.330
No one will miss her

291
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.350
No way

292
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.350
Really unfortunate, our first victim

293
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.000
Usually someone quits
After I start the introductions

294
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.270
I did not resign
Yes, I did

295
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.630
.But you still haven't realized this yet

296
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.970
.you can leave

297
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.180
.good luck

298
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.800
Any idiot can learn the technique

299
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.510
.till master it

300
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.940
But it is useless if it does not come from the depths

301
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.750
I'm not interested in "art grammar."

302
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.390
We will break the rules

303
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.610
Then I want you to bust it again

304
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.850
Let's see how far you can breach it

305
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.270
(Dalton Lambert)

306
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.730
.Yes, ma'am

307
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.990
Why the hell did I rip
Such a beautiful drawing?

308
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.500
.again for good measure

309
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.270
It wasn't very difficult, was it?

310
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.110
Well, you should forget about your past

311
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.090
Skin your skin so you can grow

312
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.450
.I'll count down from ten

313
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.640
With every number I want you to sink in

314
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.800
.again and again deep within yourselves

315
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.890
Do not remove the charcoal from the paper

316
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.350
..ten

317
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920
..nine

318
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.920
..eight

319
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.860
..Seven

320
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720
..six

321
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360
..five

322
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.170
..four

323
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:27.970
..three

324
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.070
..two

325
00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:31.990
.One

326
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.520
Draw whatever your soul leads to

327
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.010
And the feeling that it defines you

328
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.070
..you must be ready to search

329
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.770
.in your deepest and darkest thoughts

330
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.470
Does this door lock you up
Or let you out?

331
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.550
You will have to wear an earphone

332
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.010
The machine is noisy but you will be
.can hear me

333
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.170
I want you to remain as still as possible
possible until the end of the procedure

334
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.730
...if you feel like getting out of there

335
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.680
.Tap the ball and we'll stop

336
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.470
are you OK?

337
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.320
.very elated

338
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:46.990
.Go up now

339
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.470
.Take this

340
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.540
Good. Are you comfortable, Josh?

341
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.940
.Okay. Let's finish this

342
00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.410
Welcome?

343
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:05.870
Dr. Brawer?

344
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.460
Dr. Brawer?

345
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.100
There is someone with you

346
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.430
What? What did you say?

347
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.380
Dr. Brower, what did you say?

348
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120
.Come on

349
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.840
Would you take me out please?

350
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.620
!Welcome

351
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.370
Will you take me out?

352
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.430
.the door is open

353
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.070
Alright! Get me out! Dr. Brawer!

354
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.620
Get me out, Dr. Brawer

355
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.280
.Come on. Get me out of here

356
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.380
Welcome?

357
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:59.650
!You

358
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.170
.get me out. take me out

359
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.580
Dr. Brawer. Come on

360
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800
.get me out

361
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:42.900
.Good. Let's go

362
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.920
Mr. Lambert

363
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.600
What was that?
Are you okay?

364
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.170
Why did you turn off the light?

365
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.140
.just chill

366
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.120
Did you say the light is off?

367
00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.760
All the lights went out and I was stuck there

368
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.210
..I saw

369
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:03.960
.. - What is this
...(Mr. Lambert

370
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.260
I was asleep for 15 minutes

371
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.620
.all asleep

372
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.120
.and the echo is quite clear

373
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.370
What?
Take time to get dressed

374
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.690
.Come here

375
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.040
You don't have any problem physically
There are no spots on the brain

376
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.130
.nothing to worry about

377
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.470
That's good news, Mr. Lambert

378
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.630
..Yeah, I know, I am

379
00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.250
.I guess I was expecting something real

380
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.030
Something that could explain this confusion

381
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.530
It could be your memory problem
Referring to many things

382
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.160
Increased stress
A change in habits

383
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.520
Have there been changes?
in your home life?

384
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.290
My mother passed away recently

385
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.740
.I am sorry for your loss

386
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.490
Not to mention clubbing
...my son to college

387
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.870
And my ex-wife hardly
...talking to me, so

388
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.690
This looks cumbersome.
.actually -

389
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.500
Maybe an expert on death
.He can help you

390
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.930
.Yes, of course, it might work

391
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.380
Are there cases of diseases
mentality in your family?

392
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:40.610
Mental illness?

393
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.130
You don't have to worry about that

394
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.600
This can be useful for diagnosis

395
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:45.810
.not to my knowledge

396
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.400
.It would be good to investigate that

397
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.920
Meanwhile, there are exercises
.and games to stimulate memory

398
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.600
Memory board game

399
00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.940
Do you want me to play
Kids Games?

400
00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.540
We can learn a lot from children

401
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.580
.Okay

402
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:08.840
Thanks

403
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:35.490
What do you do?

404
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.900
They gave me a new room

405
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.240
So finally, no more parties

406
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.820
The happy thing is, I am
.in room 323 now

407
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:48.820
.right above you

408
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:53.200
So don't make noise, I don't want to hear you
.caress your cock in the middle of the night

409
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.200
Want to join the Brotherhood?

410
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.090
What?

411
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.630
No, my father brought it to me

412
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.620
.Here you are

413
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.980
We make fun of their clothes
And their parents' money

414
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.110
.unless you keep redecorating

415
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.100
Come on, Dalton, do something
May your father be pleased

416
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.350
What's the worst that could happen?

417
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.660
Would you like some pudding?

418
00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.400
.No thank you

419
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.910
.both

420
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.730
.as you like

421
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:33.600
are you serious?

422
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.300
Come on, stop yelling
.and come here

423
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.880
Let's immortalize this night
Dalton Lambert would enjoy it

424
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.890
What is sibling juice?

425
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.500
.do not ask -
!Welcome! Welcome -

426
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.220
Everyone, my name is Nick

427
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.800
Nick! the villain! (Nick) the villain
Nick (evil)

428
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.050
, welcome home
.and welcome to school my dears

429
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:22.640
I just want to remind you
...that bond of brotherhood

430
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.670
.are under attack

431
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.360
We must protect our right
...in celebration

432
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.150
.and to be amazing

433
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:34.180
Whites, Negroes, browns, blues
Everyone is welcome here

434
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.010
...as long as you confess

435
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.030
...and you respect

436
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.710
...that the bond of brotherhood is the last home

437
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.130
In it men can be men

438
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.870
.Thank you

439
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.090
Now, there's a lot to drink tonight

440
00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.260
...but, control yourselves

441
00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:00.030
We don't need another incident

442
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.640
Bad party

443
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.290
I agree with you, let's go upstairs
We searched other people's stuff

444
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:19.780
.Okay

445
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.150
We must not be late

446
00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.270
Permission to continue has been granted

447
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.260
.hey

448
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.390
.both

449
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.210
This is Nick's room

450
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.050
.and this is a creamy (nick) anal

451
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.100
I'll dump this in the bathroom
.I will be right back

452
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.400
.Wait

453
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.180
...Hey man

454
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.580
are you okay man

455
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.670
Do you need water or something else?

456
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.870
.make it stop
.make it stop

457
00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.390
.make it stop

458
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.310
.close the door

459
00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.020
...close

460
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.410
.close the door

461
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.410
,I am going now
.I need supplies

462
00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.130
Hi Paige, I'm Nick

463
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.140
.tonight is your night
.tonight is your night

464
00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.500
.here

465
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.790
What happened?

466
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:47.380
Be yourself

467
00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.740
Do you want to dance?

468
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:53.930
.It would be nice to dance
.we can dance

469
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.990
.let's dance

470
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.540
.tonight is your night

471
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.000
.Be quiet

472
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.580
are you OK?

473
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.330
...I think I saw something

474
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.340
What?

475
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.430
.We have to go

476
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.640
.now -
The fun has just begun.

477
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.790
Is someone in my room? -
smash, smash -

478
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.840
You're going to be in trouble, flanker

479
00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.880
what is going on?

480
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:59.050
Oh my God, we are so sorry

481
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.320
...we were looking for some privacy

482
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.560
.you know, we would have done it

483
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.360
.I prefer watching my parents do it

484
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.450
.But, you two should stick around

485
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.790
I have drunk enough
.to find you both attractive

486
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.050
.even if you look like a clown

487
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.480
Nick is evil, right?

488
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.330
You're going to be a eunuch now, Nick

489
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:25.430
Run!

490
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.980
It's good to think quickly
is not it?

491
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.710
...I

492
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.070
How stupid

493
00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.480
I didn't ask if I could kiss you

494
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.760
I'm sorry, I followed my instinct

495
00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.290
...both -
Are you well? -

496
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.280
...I'm fine, just me

497
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.550
I just apologize about
What I told you

498
00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.220
.whatever

499
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:02.410
Do you think I care what he thinks?
He should be lucky

500
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.660
.hi mate, i'm calling you again

501
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.910
I went to the doctor

502
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.370
.and everything is fine

503
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:15.360
Well, not well
...but I'll manage, so

504
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.540
.Call me as soon as you can

505
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:20.040
...well, I've already

506
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.740
I'm sorry, Dalton, about...
.what you said that day

507
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:27.130
.ok dude

508
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.310
Where's the mayonnaise?

509
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.520
Who is this?

510
00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:49.570
Please don't tell me you are
You were just snooping

511
00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.460
.What? both

512
00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:52.820
What the hell is going on?

513
00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:55.920
.come in

514
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:10.170
Something is happening to me, I see
.stuff, crazy stuff

515
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:14.890
Do you remember the boy
who had an accident?

516
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.650
.I saw him, he was dead

517
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.190
.I started a technical exercise

518
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:26.370
And the teacher told us to look for
.a memory in the depths of our subconscious

519
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.390
So, then I drew this door

520
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.180
You should leave this class

521
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:32.310
.I'm serious

522
00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.990
Tonight, I was painting
.and I fell asleep

523
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:39.680
And when I woke up this lamp appeared

524
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.810
It was like a dream but
He wasn't

525
00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.420
Then I walked to your room

526
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.700
.I know it looks bad

527
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.550
I feel like I'm getting close to something

528
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.320
.or something is approaching me

529
00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:07.230
Do you have an extra pillow?

530
00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.940
I went to my first concert

531
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:39.440
.she was awful

532
00:56:59.280 --> 00:56:59.920
.Good

.the curse

551

(Ben Burton)

552
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.300
.Scale and darken

553
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:35.840
Gradient between light and dark

554
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:41.800
An effect that is not only used to create
...size and definition

555
01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:45.610
But also to create a source
.Specific light outside the frame

556
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.570
Well, this is one of them
Goya's best paintings

557
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.020
Negative space draws
The eye is toward Saturn

558
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.770
Does that represent darkness or emptiness?

559
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.630
Goya mastered the canvas.

560
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:08.830
Been family and health problems
... led the famous painter

561
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.110
.to a whirlpool of darkness

562
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:14.160
And so he created this
...the shocking picture

563
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:17.050
A father devours his son

564
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:25.290
This balance between light and dark
.is what we are striving for

565
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:26.890
.get ready

566
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:34.280
Your experiences are what embody your artwork

567
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.390
Accept it, use it

568
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:40.980
They wandered into the depths of the darkness of memory

569
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:43.150
...ten

570
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.850
...nine

571
01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:46.660
...eight

572
01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.370
...Seven

573
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.350
...six

574
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.000
...five

575
01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.680
...four

576
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.310
...three

577
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:56.860
...two

578
01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.590
...One

Date of Birth 11-3-1948

581
01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.160
How are you?
diligent student?

582
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.230
A red door

583
01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:55.530
.a purple rooster

584
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.320
Come on man, don't you mean
you that something?

585
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.420
A red door

586
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.550
.look express than usual

587
01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:03.080
We were asked to paint a picture
.in the drawing class

588
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:05.820
We have to find a memory

589
01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:07.880
.I thought it was a memory from my childhood

590
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:09.030
Did you ask my mom?

591
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.300
No, I don't want her to worry

592
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:12.630
Why would that worry her?

593
01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:18.100
.I don't know -
Is this what happens when you go to university? -

594
01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:19.350
Are you getting mysterious?

595
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:21.430
.I think so

596
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.760
So I will not go to university

597
01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.790
So after that dreadful night
...and your dream that wasn't a dream

598
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.250
...I started thinking

599
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:56.860
...Yeah, Dalton's weird.

600
01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:58.790
"But he's not crazy, is he?

601
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.390
.I want the key back

602
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:04.160
...well, I started searching online

603
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.390
And guess what I found?

604
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.560
.you are not crazy at all

605
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:12.250
You are an astral traveler

606
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:13.600
Check this out

607
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.850
Looks like they filmed it in the store

608
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:18.870
Hey guys, this is a program

609
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:20.880
I'm Spex, and this is Tucker

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.480
Today we will talk about something
many of you

613
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.000
He was asking us about it

614
01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.250
"Astral projection"

615
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.300
It is a real phenomenon when
...our physical body falls asleep

616
01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:39.890
And... our astral body
.leaves our physical body

617
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.250
.and floats to another place

618
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:45.400
This is exactly how I feel -
I told you, cool, right? -

619
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.800
...our former teacher

620
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:48.160
...Dr. Elise Rainier

621
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:50.160
She had a different name
.so the other world

622
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.430
She called it "the isthmus."
.wait -

623
01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:00.380
...(I'm Elise

624
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.780
Nice to see you all

625
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.010
I'm here to talk to you about
."Astral projection"

626
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.440
And about the isthmus

627
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.720
...Good

628
01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.400
.a moment please

629
01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.200
.Good

630
01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:18.180
...two

631
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.090
.One

632
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.430
...isthmus

633
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.290
...dark world

634
01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.190
... crammed with the tormented souls of the dead

635
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:35.970
Some are doomed
...in the yard

636
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.590
To live the worst mistakes of their lives

637
01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.560
.again and again and forever

638
01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:45.450
...when you astral travel

639
01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:47.730
...and travel to this world

640
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.830
...those are the spirits

641
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.840
.that wakes up with your presence

642
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:54.850
.and she can smell you

643
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.330
.attend our lives

644
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.680
.life is what they long for

645
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.280
.more than anything else

646
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:06.560
...so, the farther you travel

647
01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.690
The more dangerous the journey becomes

648
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:15.730
They want life, and they can come
.to our world to get it

649
01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.600
Keep your steps steady

650
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.600
What are you thinking of now?

651
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.430
.that little boy

652
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.140
The boy who vomited?

653
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.230
.yeah, he told me something

654
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:37.210
He said, “Shut the door

655
01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.430
.Sure, he must have been embarrassed

656
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:43.790
Yeah but, what if it was
mean something else?

657
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:45.500
What if he was talking about that door?

658
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.500
So will you go back and ask him?

659
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:52.460
Are you serious?

660
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.830
.I want to know

661
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.620
I feel bad for the boy
...believe me, but

662
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.370
.but I prefer to avoid dark worlds

663
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:04.220
...there is something important

664
01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.070
About this painting, Chris

665
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:09.240

666
01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.420
.Good

667
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.650
But Nick won't
...you get in

668
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.350
to his room and talk to
.a ghost in his bathroom

669
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.630
He'll never know I'm there

670
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.010
Welcome to the party
Back to school, my dears

671
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:35.840

672
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:37.290
...I can -
can i help you -

673
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:44.910
...hey, I left my bra on

674
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:48.430
In Nick's room, and I want to know
If he is at home

675
01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:52.270
I think it's upstairs
He studies with Paige

676
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.500
.Thanks

677
01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:00.300
I'm going to read this to you, it's called
"on flames"

678
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.360
It's a very personal thing
"...Looking over the campfire"

679
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.720
I need a dark room

680
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.850
.Good

681
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.560
so what?

682
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.740
Are you going to float through the air and startle me?

683
01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:24.060
.I'm not a ghost

684
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.250
And you won't be, Casper

685
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:29.320
.here we are

686
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.500
Why are these sheets so stiff?

687
01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.560
.it should crack like toast

688
01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.560
.I prefer dirty floors

689
01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:57.600
Will you give me space? -
Yes, I'm sorry.

690
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.530
Well, are you ready?

691
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.330

Are you really floating?

701
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.970
Good luck, traveler

702
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:11.100
Are you here, Dalton?

703
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.690
Maybe I should get it
A second degree in writing.

704
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.130
But I'm pretty good at finances, which is why...

705
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.310
I don't want to waste this talent.

706
01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.040
And how long do you have to keep that?

707
01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.470
Yes, that's enough.

708
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.960

710
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.900
I'll be late.

711
01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.760
Whoops!

Sorry, I didn't know they were
They actually want to hurt you.

745
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:44.400
Yes, they can.

746
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:48.120
You don't know who you're messing with.

747
01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.230
I can't be
Part of that, Dalton.

748
01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.620
And you might not wake up next time.

749
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.560
Welcome.
Welcome.

750
01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.460
This is not the weekend then
Callie and Foster are asleep.

751
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:26.690
I'm not here for the two kids.

752
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.780
Can we talk?

753
01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.880
certainly.

754
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.930
Wow, two calls in a week.

755
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.210
- You're right, stop it.
- Do you still have friends?

756
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.710
Tell me everything you remember
When I was in a coma.

757
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:51.550
Talk to your mom.

758
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.340
I think this is...

759
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.440
The things I draw...
The Door?

760
01:15:56.670 --> 01:15:59.010
And now a man with a hammer.

761
01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.850
hammer?

762
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:05.490
I think things from my past...

763
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:08.000
Which ended in my coma, and I don't know...

764
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.910
The reason these things come back...
- Hey.

765
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.210
(Dalton).

766
01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.440
What is the matter?

767
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.750
I've had an image in my mind for years.

768
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:22.030
My mom said it wasn't real
It was a nightmare, but...

769
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.330
Tell me about it brother, hurry up.

770
01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:32.780
Well, we're in a room that's like a basement.

771
01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.470
remember that?

772
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:41.380
Do you still hear me, Dalton?

773
01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:53.740
I always wanted to be better than my dad.

774
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.480
You know that being a good father.

775
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.920
You were and still are a good father, Josh.

776
01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.020
Dalton disagrees.

777
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:06.120
If I can sympathize, you should
To make him call me back.

778
01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.090
My father abandoned his family...

779
01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:13.900
And I did the same...

780
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.290
You really didn't.

781
01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.950
You don't look like him, Josh.
And you are right to be angry with him.

782
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.210
I am angry and have been angry for a long time

783
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.050
From a man I have never met in my life.

784
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:28.650
From a man who jumped out of a hospital
Mental illness in 1978.

785
01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.570
This man passed away 40 years ago.

786
01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:36.410
he is my father.

787
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.080
(Ben Burton).

788
01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:45.560
How could he frighten me with this?
The real world?

789
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:47.890
He attacked me at my mother's house.
- He attacked you?

790
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:51.200
Yeah, am I crazy or...?

791
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.670
I don't know.

792
01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:01.500
He left this for my mom the day he died.

793
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.380
"It ends with me."

794
01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:06.710
What does he end up with?

795
01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:12.010
- (Josh)...
- Is that your answer? Am I crazy?

796
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:14.450
Am I crazy?

797
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:18.160
Is this why I feel so lost?
In the last years?

798
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:21.590
Did I pass this on to the children?
Will he go after them?

799
01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:24.470
- (Josh)...
Why didn't my mother say a word about it?

800
01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:25.610
to stop.

801
01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.630
I'm not crazy.

802
01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.260
I'm not crazy.

803
01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.310
So what ails me?

804
01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:53.080
Dalton: It wasn't a coma, and I'll find out.

805
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:23.650
(Dalton).

806
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:35.810
Which is why Dalton and I were traveling to another dimension.

807
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:41.550
Where the orcs and ghosts chased us.

808
01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.410
Or they are entities...

809
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:49.600
Like the one in the pictures that followed you...

810
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.960
Your father saw them too...

811
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.450
Maybe it's just communication.

812
01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:01.870
And he told your mom she didn't understand

813
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.390
And she didn't know how to help him.

814
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:05.060
Help him as you help us?

815
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.770
Am I suppressing her memories?

816
01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.100
We all thought we were the best
Josh, including you.

817
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.500
But you got confused.

818
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.480
Hypnosis made you feel lethargic.

819
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.420
And we didn't know what your mother and I were doing.

820
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:27.070
And I was terrified of telling you the truth.

821
01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:29.990
Dalton was right.

822
01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:36.560
He said my mom had secrets
I have had things on my mind.

823
01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:40.180
And I thought you did the same, too.

824
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.360
You hid it from me for ten years.
You don't know how difficult it is.

825
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:46.710
Why?
Honestly, you don't know anything.

826
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.570
Why?
Please, you don't understand...

827
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.620
Because you tried to kill our family.

828
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:55.940
She chased us all over the house
Blood dripping with a bat.

829
01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.820
What?
I learned

830
01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:00.390
It wasn't you, it was...

831
01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:03.850
The thing in the pictures
But the children did not understand that.

832
01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.850
All the nightmares Foster had.

833
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:10.040
I've been telling our two kids for a decade...

834
01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.940
That there is no truth to those memories.

835
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:13.780
"It's just your imagination."

836
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.450
"Your father will not harm you."

837
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.650
- I couldn't.
- But you did it.

838
01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.220
They don't care what controls you.

839
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.580
They saw your face and you
who caused them such pain.

840
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:32.200
For this purpose, I...

841
01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.170
I can't live like this anymore.

842
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:48.120
you know?

843
01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.220
We can get through this ordeal together.

844
01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:01.000
Is this your picture?

845
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:06.290
Dalton just sent it to me.

846
01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:09.430
He was having nightmares and visions.

847
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.660
Something from the red door.

848
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:15.230
And this is now.

849
01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.680
What should we do?

850
01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.020
I'm afraid.

851
01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.030
It will be fine.

852
01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.740
- It'll be all right.
I don't know.

853
01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.830
Nothing will happen to us, I promise, okay?

854
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.800
Calm your brother down, Dalton.

855
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.490
It's not your fault.

856
01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.560
Help me.

857
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:46.790
Why was my father angry at us?

858
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:03.740
ma...

859
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.720
I can go into the dark
.for my dad

860
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:08.210
No, it's risky.
- But I can do it.

861
01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.820
It's okay, but watch out.

862
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.400
Let's go.

863
01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:04.910
No, stop, what are you doing?

864
01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.880
Wait, what are you doing?

865
01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.350
Stop, please, Dad.

866
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.890
to stop.

867
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.100
no!

868
01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:19.710
to stop.

869
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:11.350
I'm just checking on you.

870
01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.000
Good.

871
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:21.020
You look strange here, that's normal.

872
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.710
So you're fine, right? because...

873
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.160
When the light went out I thought
It is the dark world.

874
01:28:30.570 --> 01:28:33.930
Since you don't like the dark
It crossed my mind...

875
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:36.900
I will light your room...

876
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.880
As I light your life.

877
01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.310
I'm not afraid of the dark anymore.

878
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.490
Good.

879
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:47.440
I brought them here
And we'll hang them anyway.

880
01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.930
Even if you're annoying, God.

881
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:55.440
So, listen.

882
01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.200
I got your letter and wrote a sarcastic reply.

883
01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:04.700
But I deleted it because Grandma Berky says
Conflict should not be exacerbated by letters.

884
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:06.210
The tone when writing is vague.

885
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:10.680
But if you ask my opinion...

886
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.210
Here's the opinion.

887
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:16.770
Don't get stuck in the past.

888
01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.380
There are things that should remain buried.

889
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:21.980
then...

890
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:25.350
Sometimes you have to move on.

891
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.920
(Dalton)?

892
01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.640
Listen.

893
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:38.310
Are you okay, Dalton?

894
01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:28.370
(Dalton).

895
01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:36.850
(Dalton).

896
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:39.800
(Dalton)?

897
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.510
(Dalton)?

898
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:07.760
no.

899
01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.250
No no.

900
01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.220
My dad is here.

901
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:25.610
I'm getting you out of here, Dalton.

902
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:40.070
We'll go out and go home, okay?

903
01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.600
We won't be back.

904
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:50.290
Dalton, what?

905
01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.360
(Dalton).

906
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.270
Dalton, tell me you're here.

907
01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.150
(Dalton).

908
01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.870
I know you're here, Dalton.

909
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:22.520
But if you touch me once
Another I will beat you up.

910
01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.310
No, dad.

911
01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:51.480
You tried to kill me.

912
01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:53.640
- I wasn't the one.
I saw you.

913
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:57.220
These things can take over our bodies.

914
01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.650
It happened to me and now it will happen to you.

915
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:04.290
He is coming to you.

916
01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:06.530
You must leave.

917
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.700
faster.

918
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:54.390
He is coming.

919
01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.920
Let's go.

920
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:02.230
Help me, Dalton.

921
01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:04.890
Help me hold the door.

922
01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:23.110
no.
We can't stop him, Dad.

923
01:35:23.130 --> 01:35:25.750
You have to try, son.

924
01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:30.770
stay away from me

925
01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:37.590
no!

926
01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.650
no! no.

927
01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:41.900
Hurry up, Dalton.

928
01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.750
Let's find something to lock it in.
Something to lock it down.

929
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:52.330
Come on, hurry up.

930
01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:54.870
- Please, Dad.
- Father.

931
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:56.650
We have to leave.

932
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:02.790
It's not your fault.

933
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:05.650
you go.

934
01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.850
Go.

935
01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:25.300
.Get away from me

936
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:35.430
no!

937
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.770
No, my God.

938
01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.290
(Josh).

939
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:52.480
(Josh).

940
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:57.560
This ends with me.

941
01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.550
paint?

942
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:48.410
Paint, it's Dalton.

943
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:50.340
Get rid of that thing.

944
01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.500
Burn it and forget about it.

945
01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:55.240
No, forgetting it does not work
Well, we have to remember.

946
01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.200
Albeit painful.

947
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:34.750
Father?

948
01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.990
It's okay, it's okay.

949
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:06.040
Is Dalton okay?

950
01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.970
he is fine.
Good.

951
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:11.340
(Dalton)

952
01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.560
He's calling.

953
01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.950
(Dalton).

954
01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.100
Is my father back?

955
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:19.670
Yes, he's back and he's fine.

956
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:51.550
See you next Friday.

957
01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.460
Tell Foster to prepare his homework
Home for history and I'll help him.

958
01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.200
Come early if
Liked and joined us for dinner.

959
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:02.730
Yes, I would like to, thank you.

960
01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:26.400
Wonderful house.

961
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:28.230
I thank you.

962
01:42:28.530 --> 01:42:30.770
- Do you live here?
I hope so.

963
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.620
What a strange answer.

964
01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:35.920
I remained immersed in memories.

965
01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.690
Memories can cloud the mind.

966
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:47.870
I know you.

967
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.190
You may have seen me around before.

968
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.680
I know your mother.

969
01:42:59.190 --> 01:43:01.510
I have so many subjects to tell you.

970
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:04.650
I know, and you can tell me about them.

971
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:07.950
And you'll tell me about them one day.

972
01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.050
You have a bright future ahead of you.

973
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.060
You and Dalton.

974
01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.390
Keep pace, Josh.

975
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:41.950
My picture was put up on the wall.

976
01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:47.030
Okay.

977
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:49.610
I love you, son.

978
01:44:50.190 --> 01:44:51.670
I love you too.

979
01:44:52.470 --> 01:45:29.860

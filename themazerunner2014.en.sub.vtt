00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.161
Hello?

2
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.211
Hello?

3
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.043
Hey! Hey! Help me!

4
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.041
Go get him.

5
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.601
Day one, Greenie.

6
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.895
Rise and shine.

7
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.095
He looks like a slopper to me.

8
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.400
I could use some
help in the kitchen.

9
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.970
Hey, we got a runner!

10
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.327
Take it all in.

11
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.805
He's all yours.

12
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.015
Hey.

13
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.886
Hey there, Green Bean.

14
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.682
You're not gonna
run again. Okay?

15
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.321
Good.

16
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.491
My name is Alby.

17
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.255
Can you tell me anything
about yourself?

18
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.327
Who you are?

19
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.484
Where you came from?
Anything at all.

20
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.561
No.

21
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.370
Can you tell me your name?

22
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.968
I, I can't remember anything.

23
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.975
Why can't I remember anything?

24
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.015
It's okay.

25
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.646
Hey, relax.

26
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.007
Relax.

27
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.575
It's normal.

28
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.330
It happens to us all.

29
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.042
You'll get your name
back in a day or two.

30
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.048
It's the one thing
they let us keep.

31
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.524
What is this place?

32
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.321
Let me show you.

33
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.769
</font> We eat here.

34
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.285
We sleep here.

35
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.855
We grow our own food.

36
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.405
We build our own shelter.

37
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.935
Whatever we need,
the Box provides.

38
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.086
The rest is up to us.

39
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.401
The Box?

40
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.735
Yeah. It's sent up once a month

41
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.127
with fresh supplies
and a new Greenie.

42
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.725
This month that's you.

43
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.371
Congratulations.

44
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.250
Sent up? By who, though?
Who put us here?

45
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.565
That, we don't know.

46
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.089
Hey, are you all right, Alby?
A-ha!

47
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.085
Green Bean, meet Newt.

48
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.924
When I'm not around,
he's in charge.

49
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.764
Well, it's a good thing
you're always around then.

50
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.922
That was some dash
you made earlier.

51
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.970
For a second, I thought you had
the chops to be a runner...

52
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.929
till you face-planted. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

53
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.286
That was great.

54
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.442
Wait, a "runner"?

55
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.171
Newt, do me a favor.
Go find Chuck.

56
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.605
All right. Thanks.

57
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.649
Look, I'm sorry to rush this.

58
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.963
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

59
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.487
We got something special
planned tonight.

60
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.922
Yeah. You'll see.

61
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.602
I hope you're not
afraid of heights.

62
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.802
Let's go. Come on.

63
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.164
This is all we got.

64
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.164
We've worked hard for it.

65
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.606
If you respect this place...

66
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.648
you and I will
get along just fine.

67
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.530
What's out there?

68
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.650
We only have three rules.

69
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.320
First, do your part.

70
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.003
No time for any freeloaders.

71
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.845
Second, never
harm another Glader.

72
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.082
None of this works
unless we have trust.

73
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.524
Most importantly...

74
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.927
never go beyond those walls.

75
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.688
Do you understand me, Greenie?

76
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.446
Hey, Alby!

77
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.806
Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?

78
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.285
It's basically the same
story for all of us.

79
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.522
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

80
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.044
then here we are.

81
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.885
Don't worry.

82
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.008
You're already
doing better than I did.

83
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.295
I clunked my pants three times

84
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.288
before they got
me out of the pit.

85
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.529
No, come on.

86
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.041
Dude, where are you going?

87
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.401
I just wanna see.

88
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.120
You can look around all you want

89
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.730
but you better not go out there.

90
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.370
Why not? What's through there?

91
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.251
I don't know. I just
know what I'm told.

92
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.731
And we're not supposed to leave.

93
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.087
</font> Hey, Chuck. New Greenie?

94
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.091
How does it feel to be promoted?

95
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.731
Feels great, Ben.

96
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.248
I thought no one
was allowed to leave.

97
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.209
I said we're not
allowed to leave.

98
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.895
They're different,
they're runners.

99
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.729
They know more about
the maze than anyone.

100
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.166
Wait, what?

101
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.600
What?

102
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.603
What? You just said "maze."

103
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.611
I did?

104
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.761
Yeah.

105
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.127
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

106
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.441
I'm just gonna take a look.

107
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.135
I told you, you can't.

108
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.766
No one leaves,
especially not now.

109
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.086
It's not safe.

110
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.443
Okay, all right,
I'm not gonna go.

111
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.095
Hey!

112
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.131
We gotta stop meeting
like this, Greenie.

113
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.575
Get off me!

114
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.726
All right! Calm, calm, calm.

115
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.935
</font> Don't touch me!

116
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.644
</font> Whoa! Take it easy!

117
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.761
Just relax.

118
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.570
What the hell is
wrong with you guys?

119
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.767
Just calm down, all right?

120
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.935
No, okay? Why won't you
tell me what's out there?

121
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.485
We're just trying to protect you.
It's for your own good.

122
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.641
You guys can't
just keep me here.

123
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.723
I can't let you leave. Why not?

124
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.811
What the hell?

125
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.409
Next time, I'm gonna
let you leave.

126
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.725
Welcome to the Glade.

127
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.241
Light him up!

128
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.882
Hell of a first day, Greenie.

129
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.601
Here.

130
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.840
Put some hair on your chest.

131
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.841
My God! What is that?

132
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.481
I don't even know.

133
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.490
It's Gally's recipe.

134
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.735
It's a trade secret.

135
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.689
Yeah, well,
he's still an asshole.

136
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.329
He saved your life today.

137
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.884
Trust me. The maze
is a dangerous place.

138
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.800
We're trapped here, aren't we?

139
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.686
For the moment.

140
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.641
But...

141
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.687
you see those guys?

142
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.005
There, by the fire?

143
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.530
Those are the runners.

144
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.724
That guy in the middle
there, that's Minho.

145
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.250
He's the Keeper of the Runners.

146
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.166
Every morning, when those doors
open, they run the maze...

147
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.335
mapping it, memorizing it,

148
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.646
trying to find a way out.

149
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.650
How long have they been looking?

150
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.240
Three years.

151
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.685
And they haven't found anything?

152
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.242
It's a lot
easier said than done.

153
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.161
Listen.

154
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.481
Hear that?

155
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.766
It's the maze, changing.

156
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.731
It changes every night.

157
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.848
How is that even possible?

158
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.535
You can ask the people
who put us in here,

159
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.688
if you ever meet the bastards.

160
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.881
Listen, the truth is...

161
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.535
the runners are the only ones

162
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.050
who really know
what's out there.

163
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.415
They are the strongest and
the fastest of us all.

164
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.495
And it's a good thing, too...

165
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.648
because if they don't make it
back before those doors close...

166
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.723
then they are stuck out
there for the night.

167
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.251
And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.

168
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.530
What happens to them?

169
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.448
Well, we call them Grievers.

170
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.855
Of course, no one's
ever seen one

171
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.370
and lived to tell about it.

172
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.930
But they're out there.

173
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.855
Right, that's enough
questions for one night.

174
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.881
Come on.

175
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.566
You're supposed to
be the guest of honor.

176
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.455
No... No! No, come on.

177
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.925
Let me show you around.

178
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.847
Come on.

179
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.095
</font> <font color="#D900D9"></font> Whoa!

180
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.690
And there we got the builders.

181
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.560
They're very good
with their hands...

182
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.563
but not a lot going on upstairs.

183
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.650
And then we got Winston...

184
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.008
he's the Keeper of the Slicers.

185
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.529
And we got two med-jacks,
Clint and Jeff.

186
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.250
Hey, what's up? Yo, Newt.

187
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.411
They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.

188
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.535
What if I want to be a runner?

189
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.846
Have you listened to
a word I've just said?

190
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.564
No one wants to be a runner.

191
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.848
And, besides,
you gotta get chosen.

192
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.095
Chosen by who?

193
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.531
</font> Whoa!

194
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.681
What do you say, Greenie?

195
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.490
Wanna see what you're made of?

196
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.570
<font color="#D900D9">Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

197
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.290
Okay. All right.

198
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.043
The rules are simple, Greenie.

199
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.725
I try to push you
out of the circle...

200
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.728
you try to last more than five seconds.</font>

201
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.800
</font>- Take it easy on the Greenie.
</font>- Ready?

202
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.606
</font> Get up, boy.

203
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.967
Come on, Greenie.
We're not done yet.

204
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.726
Stop calling me Greenie.

205
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.400
</font> Stop calling you that?

206
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.975
What do you wanna
be called? Shank?

207
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.975
What do you think, boys?

208
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.490
Does he look like a Shank?

209
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.935
</font> Whoa!

210
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.007
</font> Come on!

211
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.842
You know what? I think
I've settled on Shank.

212
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.371
There you go, Greenie!

213
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.806
Not bad for a Greenie?

214
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.121
Thomas.

215
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.210
Thomas. Hey!

216
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.041
Thomas!

217
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.440
I remember my name. I'm Thomas!

218
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.481
</font> Thomas!

219
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.645
Welcome home, Thomas.

220
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.051
Good job... Thomas.

221
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.046
What the hell was that?

222
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.884
That, my friend, was a Griever.

223
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.211
Don't worry, you're
safe here with us.

224
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.049
Nothing gets
through those walls.

225
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.001
All right, guys.

226
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.168
Let's tuck it in for
the night. Come on.

227
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.651
It was a good night.

228
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.246
Good job, man.

229
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.880
</font> You're safe here with us.

230
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.295
</font> Wicked is good.

231
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.415
</font> What's out there?

232
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.124
</font> Thomas, Thomas.

233
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.566
Can you hear me?

234
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.205
Everything is going to change.

235
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.841
</font> Thomas.

236
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.687
Shh.

237
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.000
Follow me.

238
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.604
</font> It's peaceful, isn't it?

239
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.805
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

240
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.924
We had dark days.

241
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.767
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

242
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.571
To panic.

243
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.923
We've come far since then.

244
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.005
Established order...

245
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.286
made peace.

246
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.484
Yeah. Why are
you telling me this?

247
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.763
Because you're not
like the others.

248
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.205
You're curious.

249
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.689
But you're one of us now.

250
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.808
You need to know
what that means.

251
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.044
What happened to them?

252
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.325
Like I said...

253
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.570
dark days, Thomas.

254
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.762
Has anyone tried
climbing to the top?

255
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.209
Tried it. The ivy doesn't
go all the way to the top.

256
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.562
And besides, where are
you gonna go from there?

257
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.775
And what about the Box?

258
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.120
You know, next
time it comes up...

259
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.725
No, we tried that.

260
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.689
The Box won't go back
down with someone in it.

261
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.175
Okay, what if we...

262
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.406
No, we tried it, all right?

263
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.766
Twice.

264
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.731
All right? Trust me. Anything you
think of, we've already tried.

265
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.367
The only way out of here
is through the maze.

266
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.363
Now, look, you wanna be helpful?

267
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.975
Here.

268
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.923
Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.

269
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.080
"Just get the fertilizer,
Thomas."

270
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.250
"Are you sure, guys? I can't
help in any other way?"

271
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.528
"No, just get the fertilizer."

272
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.371
"You know where it is. It's just
out in the middle of the woods."

273
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.441
You're Ben, right?

274
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.364
I don't know if we ever... <font color="#D900D9"></font>

275
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.361
Are you okay?

276
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.451
Get the hell off me!

277
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.485
It's your fault.

278
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.045
I saw you.

279
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.565
You did this.

280
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.135
I saw you!

281
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.011
Hey! Hey!

282
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.325
</font> Hey!

283
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.964
Help!

284
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.568
Help! Help!

285
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.081
Help!

286
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.135
I'll kill you!

287
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.611
</font> Hey!

288
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.331
Hold him down.

289
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.295
What are you doing? <font color="#D900D9"></font>

290
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.401
Calm down, Ben.

291
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.761
What the hell happened?

292
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.921
He just attacked me!

293
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.095
Are you okay?

294
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.201
</font> Calm down, Ben.

295
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.244
No. No.

296
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.525
All right, lift his shirt.

297
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.648
Lift his shirt. <font color="#D900D9"></font> No! No!

298
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.055
No! No! Please. Please.

299
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.491
He's been stung.

300
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.846
In the middle of the day?

301
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.011
Help me, please.

302
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.455
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Please.

303
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.970
Please, just help.

304
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.561
Put him in the pit.

305
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.200
</font> Everybody, help.
Take him to the pit.

306
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.935
No! Med-Jack!

307
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.371
Please don't do it!

308
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.207
Calm down, Ben.

309
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.521
Back down, Ben.

310
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.769
Listen to me! Please!

311
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.844
Please, stop, please!

312
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.565
He did this!

313
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.485
Please stop! No!
No, please! Help me!

314
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.165
</font> So what happened to him?

315
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.928
It's called "The Changing."

316
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.044
It's what happens
when someone gets stung.

317
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.001
Listen.

318
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.205
We haven't been able
to get a clear word

319
00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.129
out of Ben since it happened.

320
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.128
He's not making any sense.

321
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.406
And it's only gonna get worse.

322
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.695
The infection is spreading.

323
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.529
He's dangerous.

324
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.128
What did he say to you?

325
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.250
He said he saw me...

326
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.482
and that this was all my fault.

327
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.042
How could this be my fault?

328
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.771
Get some rest.

329
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.650
Alby? Yeah.

330
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.565
What's gonna happen to him?

331
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.088
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

332
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.765
Please, Minho!

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.961
Alby!

334
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.128
No, please. Please, don't.

335
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.486
Please, don't do it.

336
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.367

337
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.966
Move in!

338
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.008
No, no, no! Please!

339
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.645
No, please! Please, don't!

340
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.690
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

341
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.650
Please, stop, please!

342
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.975
</font> Push him in! Stop!

343
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.925
I'll get better!

344
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.443
He belongs to the maze now.

345
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.083
</font> Do you think he might make it?

346
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.050
Ben?

347
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.365
No.

348
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.411
No one survives
a night in the maze.

349
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.481
We just gotta forget about him.

350
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.770

351
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.808
</font> Wicked is good.

352
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.770
Don't make it easy on them.

353

</font> Thomas.

354
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.805
Everything is going to change.

355
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.170
</font> Wicked is good.

356
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.720
</font> This is gonna hurt a little.

357
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.001
</font> Wicked is good.

358
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.851
Thomas, you have to choose.

359
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.401
</font> But why would
Alby go into the maze?

360
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.882
I mean, he's not a runner.

361
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.530
</font> Things are different now.

362
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.007
Alby went to retrace Ben's
footsteps before sundown.

363
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.161
Are you gonna help?

364
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.400
So he's gonna go back to
where Ben was just stung...

365
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.686
Alby knows what he's doing...

366
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.206
all right?

367
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.850
He knows better than any of us.

368
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.364
What does that mean?

369
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.327
Well, it's like
you have heard, yeah?

370
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.450
Every month, the Box
sends up a new arrival.

371
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.204
But someone had
to be first, right?

372
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.446
Someone had to have spent a whole
month in the Glade, alone.

373
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.963
That was Alby.

374
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.642
I mean, it can't have been easy.

375
00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.015
But when those
other boys started

376
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.644
coming up,
one after the other...

377
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.802
he saw the truth.

378
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.167
And he learned that the
most important thing...

379
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.203
is that we all have each other.

380
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.328
Because we're all
in this together.

381
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.927
Yeah.

382
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.684
There you go, Greenie.

383
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.688
</font> They should be back by now.

384
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.289
What happens if
they don't make it?

385
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.610
They're gonna make it.

386
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.764
What happens if they don't?

387
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.450
They're gonna make it.

388
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.640
Come on, guys, can't we
send someone after them?

389
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.131
</font> That's against the rules.

390
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.161
Either they make it
back or they don't.

391
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.167
We can't risk
losing anyone else.

392
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.525
No.

393
00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.735
There!

394
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.001
Wait, something's wrong.

395
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.044
Come on, Minho, you can do it!

396
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.282
</font> Come on! Go!

397
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.204
</font> Come on, you can make it!

398
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.885
Minho, you gotta leave him!

399
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.610
They're not gonna make it.

400
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.848
<font color="#D900D9"></font> You gotta leave him!

401
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.206
</font> Thomas, no!

402
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.526
Good job.

403
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.202
You just killed yourself.

404
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.166
What?

405
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.250
What happened to him?

406
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.080
What does it look like?

407
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.929
He got stung.

408
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.924
What happened to his head?

409
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.607
I did what I had to do.

410
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.725
Okay. Okay, help me get him up.

411
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.121
We gotta go. The maze
is already changing.

412
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.770
Hey, Minho!

413
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.768
We can't just leave him here.

414
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.969
</font> We gotta get him up.

415
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.445
Come on.

416
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.162
Just sit him down. Sit him down.

417
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.561
This isn't going to work.
We gotta go.

418
00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.767
We gotta go!

419
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.241
Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

420
00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.526
Where? I don't know.

421
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.415
Are you telling me there's not a
single place we could take him?

422
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.689
Listen to me,
shuck-face, all right.

423
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.375
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

424
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.290
You don't get it.

425
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.446
We're already dead.

426
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.735
Two, three...

427
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.405
Two, three...

428
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.455
Okay.

429
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.325
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

430
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.401
What are you doing?

431
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.609
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

432
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.655
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

433
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.446
Minho, stay with me. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

434
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.331
Stay with me, Minho.

435
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.000
Just a little more,
we're almost there.

436
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.645
I'm sorry, Greenie. What?

437
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.801
Minho! <font color="#D900D9"></font>

438
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.365
Okay.

439
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.165
Come on.

440
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.251
Whoa!

441
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.765
Shit!

442
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.166
Whoa!

443
00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.575
Whoa!

444
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.563
You're a crazy son of a bitch.

445
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.969
Come on, follow me. Come on!

446
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.402
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

447
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.685
This section is closing.
Come on.

448
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.524
We can lose it down here!

449
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.361
Thomas!

450
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.200
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

451
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.041
Come on!

452
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.646
Come on!

453
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.165
Come on, Thomas!
Don't look back!

454
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.041
Run! <font color="#D900D9"></font>

455
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.050
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

456
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.967
Move your ass!
Let's go! Come on!

457
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.043
Come on, Greenie! Let's go!

458
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.011
Thomas!

459
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.127
Guys, get up!

460
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.324
I told you, Chuck.

461
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.528
They're not coming back.

462
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.890
</font> Let's go.

463
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.605
No way.

464
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.881
Yeah!

465
00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.881
Yes!

466
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.521
Yeah!

467
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.571
I got him, I got him, I got him.

468
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.609
Watch out. Easy.

469
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.640
What happened out there?
How did you guys make it out?

470
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.201
You saw a Griever?

471
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.603
Yeah, I saw one.

472
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.289
He didn't just see it.

473
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.442
He killed it.

474
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.044
Things are changing.

475
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.644
There's no denying that.

476
00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.409
First, Ben gets
stung in broad daylight.

477
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.644
And then Alby.

478
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.242
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

479
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.970
to go into the maze.

480
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.483
Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.

481
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.484
Yeah...
but he saved Alby's life.

482
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.766
Did he?

483
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.847
For 3 years, we have
coexisted with these things.

484
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.002
And now, you've killed
one of them.

485
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.081
Who knows what that
could mean for us.

486
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.082
What do you suggest we do?

487
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.295
He has to be punished.

488
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.011
Come on. He killed a Griever!

489
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.161
Minho.

490
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.126
You were there with him.
What do you think?

491
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.524
I think...

492
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.604
in all the time
we've been here...

493
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.650
no one has ever
killed a Griever before.

494
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.841
When I turned tail and ran...

495
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.288
this dumb shank stayed
behind to help Alby.

496
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.810
Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.

497
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.521
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

498
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.360
I say we make him a runner.

499
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.642
</font> A runner? What?</font>

500
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.009
Minho, let's not
jump the gun, here.

501
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.050
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

502
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.203
If you want to throw the
newbie a parade, that's fine.

503
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.044
Go ahead.

504
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.851
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

505
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.246
it is that you do not...

506
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.845
Okay, wait. I know that sound.

507
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.135
The Box. It's coming back up.

508
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.207
It shouldn't be.

509
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.975
</font> Newt, what do you see?

510
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.445
</font> Do you see it?

511
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.495
It's a girl.

512
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.921
</font> No way.

513
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.763
</font> I think she's dead.

514
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.965
What's in her hand?

515
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:11.082
"She's the last one... ever."

516
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.720
What the hell does that mean?

517
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.815
</font> Whoa!

518
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.085
Thomas...

519
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.246
Do you still think
I'm overreacting?

520
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.600
</font> Jeff, what's going on?

521
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.808
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

522
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.964
Hey man, I got my job
the same way you did.

523
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.770
Do you recognize her?

524
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.761
No.

525
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.044
Really? Because she
seemed to recognize you.

526
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.681
What about the note?

527
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.046
We'll worry
about the note later.

528
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.521
I think you should
worry about it now.

529
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.328
We've got enough to
deal with at the moment.

530
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.209
He's right, Newt.

531
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.855
If the Box isn't coming back up,

532
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.370
how long do you
think we can last?

533
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.043
No one said that.

534
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.847
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

535
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.601
We'll just wait until she wakes
up and see what she knows.

536
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.880
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

537
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.681
Okay.

538
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.845
Where are you going?
Back into the maze.

539
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.721
Hey.

540
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.091
Hey, Thomas.

541
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.323
What is this with you?
A death wish?

542
00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.642
You just got out and
now you want back in?

543
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.895
Newt said that no one
has ever seen a Griever

544
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.843
and lived to tell
about it, right?

545
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.401
Minho, now we have one.

546
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.604
You're telling me you're not
even a little bit curious?

547
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.364
Not really, no.

548
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.605
So, what's the plan?

549
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.683
You're gonna go out and dissect
that thing all by yourself?

550
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.604
I will if I have to.

551
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.289
Have the other runners left yet?

552
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.602
The other runners
quit this morning.

553
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.495
<font color="#D900D9"></font> After Alby
got stung, they're not

554
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.124
in any hurry to
get back out there.

555
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.963
Why are you?

556
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.604
I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.

557
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.765
All right.

558
00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.127
But you're not going
back out there alone.

559
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.720
Meet me in the woods
in half-an-hour.

560
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.129
Will this be enough?

561
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.005
Okay.

562
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.650
Let's go.

563
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.480
Come on!

564
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.523
That's disgusting.

565
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.370
There's something in there.

566
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.282
You mean, besides
a Griever pancake?

567
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.961
Whoa, what are you doing?

568
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.401
</font> Whoa!

569
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.042
I thought you said it was dead.

570
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.655
Was it a reflex?

571
00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.886
You hope.

572
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.168
Okay, come on. Let's
try and pull it out.

573
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.524
Everyone get a hand on it.
Come on.

574
00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.404
All right, ready? On three.

575
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.415
One, two, three!

576
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.649
Are you okay, Fry?
Yeah. Thanks, brother.

577
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.205
What the hell is that?

578
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.561
Interesting.

579
00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.085
</font> Okay, whatever it is...

580
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.169
can we take this up
back at the Glade?

581
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.851
Because I don't want to
meet this guy's friends.

582
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.525
He's right.

583
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.365
It's getting late. Come on.

584
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.801
</font> We found this.

585
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.887
It was inside a Griever.

586
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.646
These are the same letters we
get in our supplies. Yeah.

587
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.168
Whoever put us here obviously
made the Grievers.

588
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.815
This is the first real clue,

589
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.524
the first anything, you've
found in over 3 years.

590
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.935
Right, Minho?

591
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.166
Right.

592
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.086
</font> Newt, we gotta
go back out there.

593
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.171
Who knows where
this might lead us.

594
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.523
You see what he's
trying to do, right?

595
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.686
First he breaks our rules...

596
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.491
and then he tries to convince
us to abandon them totally.

597
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.400
The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.

598
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.921
Why now are we questioning that?

599
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.647
If Alby was here, you
know he'd agree with me.

600
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.003
This shank needs to be punished.

601
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.046
You're right.

602
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.929
Thomas broke the rules.

603
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.851
One night in the pit,
and no food.

604
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.731
Come on, Newt!
One night in the pit?

605
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.240
Do you think that's gonna stop
him from going into the maze?

606
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.521
No.

607
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.295
And we can't just
have non-runners

608
00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.322
running into the maze
whenever they feel like it.

609
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.685
So let's just
make this official.

610
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.241
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

611
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.401
Wow.

612
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.609
Gally... No, Fry.

613
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.686
Thanks, Newt.

614
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.811
Hey, where are we going?

615
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.042
You'll see.

616
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.004
It's the maze.

617
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.645
All of it.

618
00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.883
What do you mean "all of it"? I
thought you were still mapping it.

619
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.804
There's nothing left to map.

620
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.440
I've run every
inch of it myself.

621
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.765
Every cycle.

622
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.405
Every pattern.

623
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.615
If there was a way out,

624
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.483
we would have found it by now.

625
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.807
Why haven't you
told anyone this?

626
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.967
It was Alby's call.

627
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.010
People needed to believe we
had a chance of getting out.

628
00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.006
But maybe now...

629
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.765
we have a real chance.

630
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.526
Take a look at this.

631
00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.411
About a year ago, we started
exploring these outer sections.

632
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.610
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

633
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.331
Sections 1 through 8.

634
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.766
See, the way it works,

635
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.281
is every night,
when the maze changes...

636
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.329
it opens up a new section.

637
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.926
So today, Section 6 was open.

638
00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.766
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

639
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.241
The pattern
always stays the same.

640
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.483
What's so special about 7?

641
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.085
I don't know.

642
00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.043
But last night, when you
killed that Griever...

643
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.683
Section 7 was open.

644
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.366
I think it must be
where it comes from.

645
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.440
Tomorrow, you and I are
gonna take a closer look.

646
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.481
Hey!

647
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.800
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

648
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.215
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Sorry, it's just the...

649
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.446
It's the girl.

650
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.091
Is she awake?

651
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.561
You could say that.

652
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.243
Chuck, what's going on?</font>

653
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.135
Girls are awesome.</font>

654
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.400
</font> Leave me alone!

655
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.535
</font> Watch your head!</font>

656
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.215
Hey, throw one more
of those things...

657
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.765
Go away! We come in peace!

658
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.921
What happened? Just duck!

659
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.525
I don't think she
likes us very much.

660
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.480
</font> What do you want from me?
We just wanna talk.

661
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.761
I'm warning you!

662
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.535
Take cover, y'all! Take cover!

663
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.922
Hey, it's Thomas! It's Thomas!

664
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.768
I'm gonna come up, okay?

665
00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.481
Okay.

666
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.125
Just me.

667
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.645
I'm coming up.

668
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

669
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.641
Okay, just...

670
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.165
Easy, all right?

671
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.490
Where am I?

672
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.483
What is this place?

673
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.971
Why can't I remember anything?

674
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.885
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

675
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.161
Okay?

676
00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.400
Your name will come back to
you in a couple of days.

677
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.323
It's the one thing that...
Teresa.

678
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.801
What did you say?

679
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.166
My name.

680
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.803
It's Teresa.

681
00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.244
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

682
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.209
But you already knew that,
though, I guess?

683
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.324
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

684
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.686
Who are you?

685
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.560
I don't know.

686
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.083
<font color="#D900D9"></font> I can't remember.

687
00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.244
None of us here can
remember anything.

688
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.682
We all woke up here
just like you did.

689
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.525
Hey, I promise...

690
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.444
I'm gonna take this.

691
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.521
Okay. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

692
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.530
</font> What's going on up there?

693
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.884
Is she coming down?

694
00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.727
Um...

695
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.200
Hey, listen, you guys just
give us a second, okay?

696
00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:46.641
All right.

697
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.281
Come on.

698
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.888
Is this what all girls are like?

699
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.970
</font> That girl is crazy.

700
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.609
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

701
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.410
I'm not sure.

702
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.095
Ever since you came up,

703
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.770
that Box hasn't gone back down.

704
00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.325
I just think it's got
everyone a little worried.

705
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.129
Especially Gally.

706
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.603
He thinks it's my fault.

707
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.242
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

708
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.011
I remember water...

709
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.690
feeling like I was drowning.

710
00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.922
These faces staring at me.

711
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.446
And this woman's voice saying
the same thing over and over.

712
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.806
"Wicked is good."

713
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.851
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

714
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.128
Well, I thought
they were dreams.

715
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.161
You...

716
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.283
You were there.

717
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.881
You were there...

718
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.010
and you told me that
everything was gonna change.

719
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.964
What does it mean?

720
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.169
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

721
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.481
And the others don't
remember anything?

722
00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.641
No.

723
00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.330
Why are we different?

724
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.162
These were in my
pocket when I came up.

725
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.601
"W.C.K.D."

726
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.688
"Wicked is good."

727
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.881
What if we were
sent here for a reason?

728
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.015
Alby.

729
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.163
</font> We don't even
know what this stuff is.

730
01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.850
We don't know who sent it.

731
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.690
Or why it came up here with you.

732
01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.810
For all we know, this
thing could kill him.

733
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.490
He's already dying.

734
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.521
Look at him.

735
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.415
How could this possibly
make it any worse?

736
01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.887
Come on, it's worth a try.

737
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.725
All right.

738
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.726
Do it.

739
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.201
Okay.

740
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.249
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

741
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.447
No!

742
01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.371
Watch out!

743
01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.775
Get the syringe! Let go!

744
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.249
Well, that worked.

745
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.006
Okay, from now on...

746
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.243
someone stays here and watches
him around the clock.

747
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.091
Hey.

748
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.844
Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.

749
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.927
Hey, what is your
problem with me?

750
01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.404
Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.

751
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.282
First Ben, then Alby...

752
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.411
and now the girl.

753
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.043
Everybody saw
she recognized you.

754
01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.646
And I'm betting
you know who she is.

755
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.121
Gally...

756
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.763
you know we can't stay
here forever, right?

757
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.281
Who's there?

758
01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.561
It's just me.

759
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.680
Sorry, Chuck.

760
01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.126
Here.

761
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.482
You'll run better
on a full stomach.

762
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.446
Thanks, Chuck.

763
01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.324
Hey, what do you got there?

764
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.051
Wow, that came out
pretty damn good.

765
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.566
What's that for?

766
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.003
It's for my parents.

767
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.762
You remember your parents?

768
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.005
No.

769
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.002
I mean, I know I must have them.

770
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.048
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

771
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.564
but I can't miss them because
I don't remember them.

772
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.409
What do you think you're gonna
find out there tomorrow?

773
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.251
I don't know.

774
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.255
But if there's a way out, Chuck,

775
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.089
me and Minho are gonna find it.

776
01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.601
Here.

777
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.449
Chuck, why would
you give this to me?

778
01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.923
I can't remember them anyway.

779
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.295
But maybe if you find a way out,

780
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.970
you can give it to them for me.

781
01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.410
I'll let you get some sleep.

782
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.326
Hey, Chuck.

783
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.121
Come here.

784
01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.165
Put out your hand.

785
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.482
I want you to give
that to them yourself.

786
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.965
We're gonna get out of here.

787
01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.481
All of us.

788
01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.807
Okay?

789
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.970
I promise.

790
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.805
Yeah. All right.

791
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.522
Good night. Good night, buddy.

792
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.535
Big day, Greenie.

793
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.360
Are you sure you don't
wanna sit this one out?

794
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.360
Come on, man. Get me out of here.
All right.

795
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.961
Let's go!

796
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.888
This way. Not much further
to the inner ring.

797
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.371
Let's go!

798
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.801
Come on! This way.

799
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.769
</font> That's strange.

800
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.881
</font> What?

801
01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.247
Seven is not supposed to
be open for another week.

802
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.405
</font> What the hell is this place?

803
01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.164
</font> We call them blades.

804
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.168
It's Ben's, isn't it?

805
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.731
Yeah.

806
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.121
A Griever must have
pulled him down here.

807
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.451
Whoa, hey!

808
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.363
I think it's showing us the way.

809
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.567
Wait, wait, wait. What, what?

810
01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.729
This way. Come on.

811
01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.045
Minho, you ever see
this place before?

812
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.851
No.

813
01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.408
It's just another dead end.

814
01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.490
Are you sure about this?

815
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.286
Nope.

816
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.805
Grievers.

817
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.290
What the hell was that?

818
01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.804
We gotta get out of here.

819
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.803
Give me the key,
give me the key!

820
01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.726
Move, move!

821
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.169
We gotta go! Run, Thomas!

822
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.970
We're gonna get trapped!

823
01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.326
Go! Go!

824
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.961
</font> Go, go, go!</font>

825
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.121
Move!

826
01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.161
Minho!

827
01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.850
</font> Come on! Let's go, let's go!

828
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.801
Come on, move!

829
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.962
Keep going!
Keep going! Let's go!

830
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.645
</font> Whoa!

831
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.365
Go, go, go!

832
01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.767
Go, go, go!

833
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.651
</font> Whoa!

834
01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.364
Come on! Don't look back!

835
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.535
Come on!

836
01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.724
Shit!

837
01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.401
There! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

838
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.480
</font> What the hell's
going on out there?

839
01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.000
What the hell you
done now, Thomas?

840
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.575
We found something,
a new passage.

841
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.840
We think it could be a way out.

842
01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.724
Really? It's true.

843
01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.326
We opened a door, something
I'd never seen before.

844
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.084
I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.

845
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.441
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

846
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.762
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

847
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.126
And you want us to go in?

848
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.880
Their way in could
be our way out, Chuck.

849
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.287
Yeah, or there could be a dozen
Grievers on the other side.

850
01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.649
The truth is, Thomas doesn't
know what he has done, as usual.

851
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.575
Yeah, at least I did
something, Gally.

852
01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.761
I mean, what have you done?

853
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.962
Aside from hide behind
these walls all the time?

854
01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.480
Let me tell you
something, Greenie.

855
01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.166
You've been here 3 days, all right?
I've been here 3 years!

856
01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.482
Yeah, you've been here 3 years
and you're still here, Gally!

857
01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.761
What does that tell you?

858
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.455
Maybe you should start doing
things a little differently.

859
01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.642
Maybe you should be in
charge, what about that?

860
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.643
Hey, it's Alby!

861
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.122
He's awake.

862
01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.486
Has he said anything?

863
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.801
No.

864
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.965
Alby...

865
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.204
Alby, are you all right?

866
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.568
Hey, Alby.

867
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.971
Alby, we might have just
found a way out of the maze.

868
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.924
Do you hear me? We could
be getting out of here.

869
01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.883
We can't.

870
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.290
We can't leave.

871
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.522
They won't let us.

872
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.091
What are you talking about?

873
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.366
I remember.

874
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.442
What do you remember?

875
01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.610
You.

876
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.088
You were always
their favorite, Thomas.

877
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.175
Always.

878
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.571
Why did you do this?

879
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.175
Why did you come here?

880
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.721
Winston, what's going on?

881
01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.962
It's the doors.
They aren't closing.

882
01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.321
Chuck, go to the Council Hall

883
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.044
and start barricading the doors.

884
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.929
Winston, you go with him.
Got it.

885
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.521
Get the others. Tell them to go
to the forest. Go hide, now!

886
01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.088
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

887
01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.368
I'll meet you at Council Hall.
Let's go.

888
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.095
Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.

889
01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.368
All right, everybody hide!

890
01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.761
Teresa!

891
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.924
Come on! Run! Run!

892
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.201
Stay down!

893

</font> Run!

894
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.055
Zart!

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.129
</font> Help me!
Go! Get to the village!

896
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.655
Go, go, go!

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.770
Stay down, stay down!

898
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.726
Gally! Let me in, let me in!

899
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.204
</font>- Alby!
</font>- Are you okay?

900
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.361
What's going on?

901
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.135
They're here. Grievers?

902
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.010
Thomas, what do we do?

903
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.561
It's got me! <font color="#D900D9"></font>

904
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.651
Everybody, run, run, run!

905
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.211
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

906
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.762
Everyone, go. Go, go!

907
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.167
Keep moving! Shit!

908
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.925
</font> Alby!

909
01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.560
Get behind me!

910
01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.410
Come on!

911
01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.726
</font> Over here, let's go!

912
01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.486
Over here! Let's go! Come on!

913
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.000
Over here, come on!

914
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.525
Winston!

915
01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.841
Get Alby inside.

916
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.370
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

917
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.255
Lock down the doors!

918
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.215
</font> Careful.</font>

919
01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.651
</font> Whoa!

920
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.960
</font> Stay back, guys.

921
01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.440
</font> Is everyone all right?

922
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.244
</font> Help!

923
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.164
Hey, grab him! Help!

924
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.400
Watch out!

925
01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.041
</font> Chuck!

926
01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.364
</font> Grab him!

927
01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.655
Pull him back!

928
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.610
</font> Help! Chuck, don't let go!

929
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.364
No shit!

930
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.455
</font>- Pull!
</font>- Don't let him go!

931
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.051
Chuck, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

932
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.767
Thanks, Alby.

933
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.685
Alby! Watch Out! <font color="#D900D9"></font>

934
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.921
</font> Grab him!

935
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.722
Thomas, get them out.

936
01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:21.967
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Alby!

937
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.726
</font> Thomas...

938
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.445
- Thomas!
</font>- Don't go out there!

939
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.647
</font> No, Thomas, wait!

940
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.445
Thomas, wait!

941
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.285
</font> Where is everybody?

942
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.164
Who's that over there?

943
01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.128
Gally... <font color="#D900D9"></font></font>

944
01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.651
This is all you, Thomas!
Look around!

945
01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.450
</font> Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

946
01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.575
</font> You heard what Alby said!

947
01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.960
- He's one of them!
</font>- One of who?

948
01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.883
He's one of them,
and they sent him here

949
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.843
to destroy everything,
and now he has!

950
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.760
Look around, Thomas!
Look around!

951
01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.961
This is your fault!

952
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.840
</font> Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

953
01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.645
</font> What are you talking about?
Calm down.

954
01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.575
</font> They sent him here,

955
01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.935
and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!

956
01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.450
</font> What are you talking about?

957
01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.124
Maybe he's right.

958
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.044
Thomas...

959
01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.561
</font> I need to remember, Teresa.

960
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.484
Thomas...

961
01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.688
Thomas! No, don't!

962
01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.367
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Thomas!

963
01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.806
Chuck, get the other syringe!

964
01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.490
It's okay.

965
01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.369
Thomas, I'm here.

966
01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.481
</font> Who put us here?

967
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.526
</font> That we don't know.

968
01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.041
</font> Teresa...

969
01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.929
why are we doing this?

970
01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.000
</font> Excellent, Thomas.

971
01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.207
Come with me.

972
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.763
- Wicked isn't good.
</font>- Thomas...

973
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.445
Wicked is good.

974
01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.815
</font> How could this be my fault?

975
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.001
</font> You did this!

976
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.851
I saw you!

977
01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.047
</font> I can't keep watching them die.

978
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.530
</font> Hey.

979
01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.530
Are you okay?

980
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.724
What the hell were you thinking?

981
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.566
What happened?

982
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.730
</font> Gally has taken control.

983
01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.770
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

984
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.605
or get banished
at sundown with you.

985
01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.241
<font color="#D900D9"></font> And the others agreed to that?

986
01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.975
Gally has everyone
convinced that

987
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.128
you're the reason
all this has happened.

988
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.247
Well, he's been right so far.

989
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.404
What are you talking about?

990
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.084
This place...

991
01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.241
it's not what we thought it was.

992
01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.241
It's not a prison, it's a test.

993
01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.082
It all started
when we were kids.

994
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.970
They would give us
these challenges.

995
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.126
They were experimenting on us.

996
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.323
And then people
started disappearing.

997
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.290
Every month, one after the
other, like clockwork.

998
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.523
They were sending
them up into the maze.

999
01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.367
Yeah, but not all of us.

1000
01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.684
What do you mean?

1001
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.610
Guys, I'm one of them.

1002
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.646
The people who put you
here, I worked with them.

1003
01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.205
I watched you guys for years.

1004
01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.451
The entire time
you have been here...

1005
01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.642
I was on the other side of it.

1006
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.805
So were you.

1007
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.841
What?

1008
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.801
Teresa, we did this to them.

1009
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.006
No.

1010
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.810
That can't be true.

1011
01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:25.408
</font> It is. I saw it.

1012
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.322
Why would they send us
up if we were with them?

1013
01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.484
It doesn't matter.

1014
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.325
</font> He's right.

1015
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.650
It doesn't matter.

1016
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.164
Any of it.

1017
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.325
Because the people we were before
the maze don't even exist anymore.

1018
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.562
These Creators
took care of that.

1019
01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.401
But what does matter is who
we are now, and what we do...

1020
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.210
right now.

1021
01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.891
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

1022
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.363
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

1023
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.250
Maybe.

1024
01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.415
But I know that if he were here,

1025
01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.728
he would be telling you
the exact same thing.

1026
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.123
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

1027
01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.566
Because if we do nothing...

1028
01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.889
then that means Alby died for
nothing, and I can't have that.

1029
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.925
Okay.

1030
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.008
Okay, but we gotta
get through Gally first.

1031
01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.003
This is such a waste.

1032
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.966
Gally...

1033
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.768
It doesn't feel right, man.

1034
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.366
</font> Yeah, what if Thomas is right?

1035
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.282
Maybe he can lead us home.

1036
01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.482
We are home.

1037
01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.770
Okay?

1038
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.010
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

1039
01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.535
You really think banishing us

1040
01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.847
is gonna solve anything?

1041
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.971
No.

1042
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.122
But this isn't a banishing.

1043
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.127
It's an offering.

1044
01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.175
What? Wait!

1045
01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.248
Gally, what are you doing?

1046
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.255
You really think
I'm gonna let Thomas

1047
01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.089
back into the maze
after what he has done?

1048
01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.524
Look around you!

1049
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.926
Look at our Glade!

1050
01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:09.490
This is the only way.

1051
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.928
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1052
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.648
everything goes back
to the way it was.

1053
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.040
Are you listening to this?

1054
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.735
Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!

1055
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.728
You shut up. If you stay here,

1056
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.046
the Grievers are
going to come back.

1057
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.163
They're gonna come back, and
they're gonna keep coming back...

1058
01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.481
until you're all dead!

1059
01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.483
Shut up! Tie him up!

1060
01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.162
Do you hear me?
I said tie him up!

1061
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.804
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

1062
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.204
You don't have to come with
us, but we are leaving.

1063
01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.647
Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1064
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.365
Don't listen to him, he's
just trying to scare you.

1065
01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.921
No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.

1066
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.044
I'm scared.

1067
01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.015
But I'd rather risk
my life out there

1068
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.724
than spending the rest
of it in here.

1069
01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.082
We don't belong here.

1070
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.451
This place isn't our home.

1071
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.044
We were put here.

1072
01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.010
We were trapped here.

1073
01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.007
At least, out there
we have a choice.

1074
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.282
We can make it out of here.

1075
01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.567
I know that.

1076
01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.445
I'm sorry.

1077
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.601
</font> Gally, it's over.

1078
01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.760
Just come with us.

1079
01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.727
Good luck against the Grievers.

1080
01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.005
</font> Everybody, this way!

1081
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.043
Keep it up, guys,
we're almost there!

1082
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.045
Is it a Griever? Yeah.

1083
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.286
Shit.

1084
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.200
You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.

1085
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.886
It's okay. Just stick with me.

1086
01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.535
Once we're through,
it will activate

1087
01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.846
and the door will open.

1088
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.128
We stay close,
we stick together...

1089
01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.561
we get through this.
We get out now...

1090
01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.802
or we die trying.

1091
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.881
Ready?

1092
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.362
All right. Let's go!

1093
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.365
</font> Get up, look out!

1094
01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.361
Push it!

1095
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.881
Look out!

1096
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.166
The key!

1097
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.561
Chuck! Watch the edge!

1098
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.447
No.

1099
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.843
I got you, Chuck! Pull me up!

1100
01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.686
</font> Come on!

1101
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.607
Thomas! Thomas!

1102
01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.161
Chuck?

1103
01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.691
We got more coming!

1104
01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.282
Keep it steady, guys!

1105
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.601
It works!

1106
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.769
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Teresa, go!

1107
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.961
</font>- Don't back down! Keep pushing!
</font>- Stay together!

1108
01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.445
There's gotta be
a way out! Come on!

1109
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.121
</font> Watch it!

1110
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.482
</font> It won't open!

1111
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.081
Thomas! There's a code!

1112
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.327
Eight numbers!

1113
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.125
Eight sections of the maze.

1114
01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.295
Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?
What?

1115
01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.163
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1116
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.010
Seven! One!

1117
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.164
Five! Two!

1118
01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.163
Six! Four! Heads up!

1119
01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.975
</font> Minho!

1120
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.001
</font> Minho!

1121
01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.765
<font color="#D900D9"></font> Get off of me!

1122
01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.806
Jeff!

1123
01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.760
What's the sequence? Come on!

1124
01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.646
Six! Four! Eight!

1125
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.370
Three! You got it?

1126
01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.531
</font> Keep holding!

1127
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.926
Almost there, come on!

1128
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.121
</font> The door opened!

1129
01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.485
Seriously?

1130
01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.685
</font> What happened here?

1131
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.523
So they were watching us.

1132
01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.370
This whole time.

1133
01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.570
Hello.

1134
01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.882
My name is Doctor Ava Paige.

1135
01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.855
I'm Director of Operations

1136
01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.282
of the World Catastrophe
Killzone Department.

1137
01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.895
If you're watching this,
that means

1138
01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.924
you have successfully
completed the Maze Trials.

1139
01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.529
I wish I could be there in
person to congratulate you...

1140
01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.086
but circumstances seem
to have prevented it.

1141
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.766
I'm sure by now, you must
all be very confused...

1142
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.647
angry...

1143
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.290
frightened.

1144
01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.603
I can only assure you, that
everything that's happened to you...

1145
01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.046
everything we've done to you...

1146
01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.248
it was all done for a reason.

1147
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.649
You won't remember...

1148
01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.565
but the Sun has
scorched our world.

1149
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.880
Billions of lives
lost to fire...

1150
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.761
famine...

1151
01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.250
suffering on a global scale.

1152
01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:45.404
The fallout was unimaginable.

1153
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.811
What came after was worse.

1154
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.125
We called it the Flare.

1155
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.727
A deadly virus that
attacks the brain.

1156
01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.723
It is violent...

1157
01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.405
unpredictable...

1158
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.129
incurable.

1159
01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.970
Or so we thought.

1160
01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.055
In time, a new
generation emerged

1161
01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.889
that could survive the virus.

1162
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.567
Suddenly, there was a
reason to hope for a cure.

1163
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.491
But finding it
would not be easy.

1164
01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.769
The young would have to be
tested, even sacrificed...

1165
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.282
inside harsh environments...

1166
01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.488
where their brain activity
could be studied.

1167
01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.970
All in an effort to understand...

1168
01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.282
what makes them different...

1169
01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.324
what makes you different.

1170
01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.608
You may not realize it...

1171
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.127
but you're very important.

1172
01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:44.324
Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.

1173
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.575
As you will no doubt
soon discover,

1174
01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.682
not everyone agrees
with our methods.

1175
01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.003
Progress is slow,
people are scared.

1176
01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.815
It may be too late for us...

1177
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.683
for me...

1178
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.205
but not for you.

1179
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.929
The outside world awaits.

1180
01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.931
Remember...

1181
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.805
Wicked is good.

1182
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.085
Is it over?

1183
01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.848
She said we were important.

1184
01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.528
What are we supposed to do now?

1185
01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.764
I don't know.

1186
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.924
Let's get out of here.

1187
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.601
</font> No.

1188
01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.930
Gally? Don't.

1189
01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.849
He's been stung.

1190
01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.771
We can't leave.

1191
01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.802
We did. Gally, we're out.

1192
01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.206
We're free.

1193
01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:43.726
Free?

1194
01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.202
You think we're free out there?

1195
01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.641
No.

1196
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:56.087
No, there's no escape
from this place.

1197
01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.725
Gally, listen to me.

1198
01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.167
You're not thinking straight.

1199
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.921
You're not.

1200
01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.802
Now, we can help you.

1201
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.322
Just put down the gun.

1202
01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.849
I belong to the maze.

1203
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.729
</font> Just put down the gun.

1204
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.165
We all do.

1205
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.331
Thomas...

1206
01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.611
Chuck. <font color="#D900D9"></font>

1207
01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.123
Shit. Shit.

1208
01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.531
Look at me, look at me!

1209
01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:58.881
Shit! <font color="#D900D9"></font>

1210
01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.530
</font> Chuck, look at me, all right?

1211
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.205
I got you, buddy. Just hang on.

1212
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.211
It's okay.

1213
01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.045
Thomas, Thomas...

1214
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.522
No, Chuck. You're gonna
give it to them yourself.

1215
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:14.720
Remember, I told you that.

1216
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.040
Take it.

1217
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.846
</font> No.

1218
01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.401
Thank you.

1219
01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.561
Thank you.

1220
01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.080
No, Chuck, you're gonna get...

1221
01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.721
Chuck.

1222
01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.084
Chuck? Hey.

1223
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.729
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1224
01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.284
Come on, wake up!

1225
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.081
</font> Damn it!

1226
01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.963
<font color="#D900D9"></font> We made it. Come on.

1227
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.684
I'm sorry!

1228
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.251
God damn it! <font color="#D900D9"></font>

1229
01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.603
Damn it!

1230
01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:17.761
</font> Chuck!

1231
01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.687
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1232
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:37.921
</font> Chuck!

1233
01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:41.443
You can't just leave him there!

1234
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:20.520
You guys all right?

1235
01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.401
Don't worry.

1236
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.925
You're safe now.

1237
01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.090
Relax, kid.

1238
01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.801
Everything is gonna change.

1239
01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.928
I think it's safe to say the Maze
Trials were a complete success.

1240
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.967
I wasn't expecting
so many survivors, but...

1241
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.240
the more the merrier.

1242
01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.406
Thomas continues to
surprise and impress.

1243
01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:43.526
And for now, they seem
to have taken the bait.

1244
01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.563
It's too soon to say...

1245
01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.402
but they could be
the key to everything.

1246
01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:54.605
So let's move forward.

1247
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.443
It's time now
to begin Phase Two.

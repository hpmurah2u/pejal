1
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.677
- This is gonna be rough.
- Yep.

2
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.788
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, Daniela.

3
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:35.704
I'm rushing to security.
Is everything okay?

4
00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.532
Yeah, we're fine.
Just checking in.

5
00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:39.099
- Sorry.
- Are you gonna make it?

6
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:41.275
Yeah, I think med-checks
should go quickly.

7
00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:43.799
I meant make it here
before midnight.

8
00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:45.105
You're still in Singapore.

9
00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:47.977
Well, Hawaii is 18 hours behind.

10
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.023
It's just over six hours to
Tokyo. Another six to Honolulu.

11
00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.504
So, I'll be there
with plenty of time to spare.

12
00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:56.116
New year's Eve. One delay...

13
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.118
Hey, hey.
There won't be any delays.

14
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.076
Hold on.

15
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.947
Hey, sorry. I'm running late
this morning.

16
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:03.186
I just need to scan your badge,

17
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.317
and we'll get you
through quickly.

18
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.213
Thank you.

19
00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:08.365
Now, tell your aunt Carrie I'm
expecting some homemade haggis,

20
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.608
neeps, and tatties
waiting for me, all right?

21
00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:12.610
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

22
00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:15.222
Hey, dad.

23
00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:17.137
I'm really glad
that we're doing this.

24
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.183
And I'm sorry that it's taken
so long for us to be together.

25
00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:23.099
Brodie don't apologize. I know
you have a busy life at school.

26
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.666
Yeah, thanks to you.

27
00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.190
That's my job, sweetheart.

28
00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:28.887
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

29
00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:32.239
Well, almost.

30
00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:45.077
- Captain torrance?
- Yeah, sorry I'm late.

31
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.515
It's fine, sir. The flight officer
hasn't even come by yet.

32
00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:50.866
- Good.
- Oh. Samuel dele.

33
00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.260
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

34
00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:56.263
- Happy new year.
- And to you.

35
00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:58.700
- Where are you from?
- Uh, Hong Kong, sir.

36
00:02:58.743 --> 00:03:00.789
Did my training at the
civil aviation department.

37
00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:03.400
Oh, yeah.
I hear that's a great academy.

38
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:07.709
And you, sir?
English, I'm guessing?

39
00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:10.886
Hell, no.
I wouldn't lower myself.

40
00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.237
- Nope. I'm Scottish.
- Oh.

41
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:18.676
Although I did fly
raf transport years ago.

42
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.463
Back then, all the sexy assignments
went to the English blokes.

43
00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.682
I didn't mind, though,
because for me,

44
00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.119
the heavies were an easy path
into the airlines.

45
00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:32.255
Well, it looks like they're
pushing us through weather.

46
00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.379
Of course they are.

47
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.826
Gentlemen, let's see.

48
00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.045
One-hundred and nineteen,
fourteen passengers.

49
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.960
Everything cleared.
Any questions?

50
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.615
Yeah. Looks like we're pushing
through some serious weather.

51
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.530
It's converging here
over the south China sea.

52
00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:48.334
We're aware of it.
By the time you get there,

53
00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:51.056
- it should have moved inland.
- What if it sits there and stews?

54
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.494
We can push out east,
come north over luzon?

55
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:57.193
That adds an hour
and 18k in fuel.

56
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.282
The flight's nearly empty,
so we need to shorten.

57
00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:01.153
Take it to 37.
You'll clear that weather.

58
00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:02.503
Good flight. Happy new year.

59
00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:04.418
Happy new year.

60
00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:08.204
Do our iPads control
the weather like his does?

61
00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:11.381
There you go.

62
00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:14.297
Hello, gentlemen.

63
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:15.970
My name's Bonnie.
I'll be your chief tonight.

64
00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:17.929
- Oh. Nice to meet you, Bonnie.
- Good to meet you.

65
00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:19.911
Um, captain,
you're needed in the jetway.

66
00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:24.133
- Okay.
- See you soon, cap.

67
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.968
Captain torrance, flight
commander. How can I help you?

68
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:34.926
Fugitive extradition to Toronto.

69
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.711
We'll be with you
as far as Tokyo.

70
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:39.274
He'll remain in constraints and
be under my constant supervision.

71
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.586
Well, is he dangerous?
What did he do?

72
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.892
Homicide. 15 years ago.

73
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.896
Wasn't expecting that.

74
00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.985
We found him in Bali
under an alias.

75
00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:51.900
And he's been around,
I'll say that.

76
00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:55.251
Yeah, this is a bare flight. You're
gonna attract a lot of attention.

77
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.135
I don't wanna scare
the rest of the passengers.

78
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.776
I'm afraid
you're stuck with us, captain.

79
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.086
All right.

80
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.914
Just keep away
from everyone else, please.

81
00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:06.958
Copy that.

82
00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:09.874
Let's go.

83
00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.738
- Did you check the back there?
- Everything is set back there.

84
00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:28.937
Evening, ladies.

85
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.175
- Evening, captain.
- Evening. How are you?

86
00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.307
- Ah, Isabella, how are you?
- Hey. Good.

87
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.375
- Yeah.
- Good, good.

88
00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.377
- Maria. Pleasure.
- Hi, Maria. Yeah.

89
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.205
Brodie torrance.

90
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:37.661
We're all ready to get out
of Singapore?

91
00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:39.948
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Let's go.

92
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.689
Okay.

93
00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:43.908
Okay, confirming 14 passengers.

94
00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:46.433
Fourteen passengers.
New year's light.

95
00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:49.697
I'm sure everybody's seen
our special guest at the back?

96
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.699
- Louis gaspare, 35b.
- Mmm-hmm.

97
00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:52.743
What did he do?

98
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.790
I'm sure
the less we know, the better.

99
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:59.228
You know, just keep your interactions
with him to a minimum. That's all.

100
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:01.230
- All right? Good.
- Yep.

101
00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:02.729
So, we're gonna get
this new year started?

102
00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:04.189
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

103
00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.645
All right. Get 'em on board.
Let's have a good flight.

104
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.497
- Okay.
- Same to you.

105
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:08.822
- How you doing?
- Hi, there.

106
00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.326
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

107
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.719
Yeah, just back there.

108
00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:13.242
- Happy new year.
- Thanks.

109
00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:15.244
- Hi. Happy new year.
- Hi.

110
00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:17.289
- Hi. Hi.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.180
- Hi. Happy new year.
- I'm not gonna resend it.

112
00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:21.032
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:22.706
- They've seen his face.
- Happy new year.

114
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.471
They've... they've seen it. I...

115
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:27.841
- Gary, I can't make them sign.
- Hi, happy new year.

116
00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:29.234
- Hey.
- Happy new year.

117
00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:30.714
- Hey, how are you?
- I can't make them sign.

118
00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:32.629
- How're you doing?
- That's your...

119
00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:34.829
Hello. Happy new year.

120
00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:36.372
- D-f, just right here.
- Hello.

121
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.356
You gotta be kidding me?
How'd you get an upgrade?

122
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.095
Trailmiles.

123
00:06:40.138 --> 00:06:42.314
I've gotta sit
on my own, in coach.

124
00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:43.596
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

125
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.380
They should tell you
when you buy your ticket

126
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.885
- how old the plane will be.
- No kidding.

127
00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:49.409
Oh, no need to worry, folks.

128
00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:51.541
These planes
are pretty much indestructible.

129
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:52.779
Hey, girls.
Happy new year.

130
00:06:52.803 --> 00:06:54.979
- Hi.
- Hi, hi.

131
00:06:55.023 --> 00:06:56.024
- Hey.
- Hi.

132
00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:00.811
- I think that's everybody.
- Yeah. Good.

133
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:03.640
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

134
00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:05.468
Excuse me, ladies.
That's far enough.

135
00:07:05.512 --> 00:07:06.774
But these are our seats.

136
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.080
I'm in 34d.

137
00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:11.169
It's fine, ladies.
That row there is all yours.

138
00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:12.997
Okay.

139
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:14.148
Do you wanna sit by the window?

140
00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:15.173
Yeah, thanks.

141
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.886
- Ma'am, can I help you?
- Oh, thank you.

142
00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:07:33.104 --> 00:07:34.386
- make sure your seats...
- Excuse me.

144
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.648
- Are in an upright position...
- Thanks.

145
00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:37.128
That your seatbelts
are fully fastened

146
00:07:37.152 --> 00:07:39.589
and any carry-on items
you have are fully stowed.

147
00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:41.809
Once again, thank you
for flying trailblazer.

148
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.029
- Set to Max.
- Takeoff trail.

149
00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:46.466
Trim set for takeoff.

150
00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:47.684
And flight controls.

151
00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:49.730
Flight controls, free and clear.

152
00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:50.818
Check is complete.

153
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:52.181
Passengers
all tucked in, captain.

154
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.125
All right, let's close it up.
Thanks, Bonnie.

155
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:00.412
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

156
00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:02.743
Welcome to trailblazer
flight 119.

157
00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:04.701
This is your captain speaking.

158
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:08.705
If your next stop is Tokyo,
then you're in the right place.

159
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:11.099
If you're not going to Tokyo,

160
00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:13.493
then you're about to have
a really long morning.

161
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.233
Flight time this evening

162
00:08:15.277 --> 00:08:17.148
is six hours and thirty minutes.

163
00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:21.326
And luckily, I know a shortcut,
so we might be there a little early.

164
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.415
We'll be taking off
just as soon as I learn

165
00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.983
a few pages of this
flight manual. Thank you.

166
00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:31.206
Ready for pushback?

167
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:33.556
- Ready for pushback.
- Make the call.

168
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.440
- No point to stress about it.
- That's true...

169
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.057
Air traffic controller
on radio: Trailblazer 119,

170
00:08:37.081 --> 00:08:39.475
you're clear to taxi
runway zero-two left.

171
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.564
Trailblazer 119,
Roger that.

172
00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:43.479
Taxiing runway zero-two left.

173
00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:54.098
This is one view
that never gets old.

174
00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:58.494
Trailblazer 119 in position,
ready for takeoff.

175
00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.322
Trailblazer 119,

176
00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:01.932

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:07.677
Fly runway heading.

180
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.462
Climb and maintain 2,000.
Trailblazer 119.

181
00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:13.596
Takeoff power is set.
Airspeed alive.

182
00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:17.078
Eighty. Cross-checks.

183
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:21.691
90, 100, 110,

184
00:09:22.518 --> 00:09:24.738
120, v-one.

185
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.262
Rotate.

186
00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:37.925
- Positive rate, landing gear up.
- Landing gear up.

187
00:09:37.968 --> 00:09:39.491
- Flaps up.
- Flaps up.

188
00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.382
Trailblazer 119, turn right,

189
00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:43.321

192
00:09:51.982 --> 00:09:53.307
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:54.942
this is your captain speaking.

194
00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:57.640
We've reached our cruising
altitude of 37,000 feet.

195
00:09:57.684 --> 00:09:58.791
If there's anything you need...

196
00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:00.184
Sir, would you care
for some almonds?

197
00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:01.775
Please don't hesitate to ask.

198
00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:03.298
We at trailblazer

199
00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:05.363
appreciate you spending
your new year's day with us.

200
00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:06.954
Thank you.

201
00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:09.304
Hey, do you want
to take a picture with him?

202
00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:10.566
- What?
- A picture.

203
00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:12.437
Come on.

204
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:19.682
- Could you not do that?
- Sorry.

205
00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:29.759
Beautiful family.

206
00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:33.154
Thank you. Just...

207
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.070
It's a juggle.

208
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:37.114
But we make it work.

209
00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:39.551
How about you, cap?

210
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.641
- Do you have a family?
- Yeah, I have a daughter.

211
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:44.861
Actually, here. Here she is.

212
00:10:47.472 --> 00:10:48.473
Daniela.

213
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:51.607
I see the resemblance.

214
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.914
You think?

215
00:10:53.957 --> 00:10:57.221
- And where's home?
- Daniela goes to college in California.

216
00:10:57.265 --> 00:11:02.357
And, uh, I'm based
out of Singapore.

217
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.013
The distance must be quite
challenging for you and your wife, no?

218
00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:10.887
Well, my wife actually passed
three years ago.

219
00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:15.805
- I'm so sorry, captain.
- No, no.

220
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:18.199
Thank you. Nah, it's okay.

221
00:11:41.657 --> 00:11:43.615
- Happy new year.
- Oh, thank you.

222
00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:44.680
What can I
get for you, sir?

223
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.748
Uh, gin.

224
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:47.619
Do you need any tonic
or soda water?

225
00:11:47.663 --> 00:11:49.099
Just gin. Just the gin.

226
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.550
We're cutting right through
the top of the storm.

227
00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:10.642
So much for "moving inland."

228
00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:14.492
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

229
00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:16.431
The seatbelt signs
have been turned on.

230
00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:19.216
Please remain in your seats with
your seatbelts secure. Thank you.

231
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:27.442
Trailblazer 119, requesting
climb to 40,000 to clear weather.

232
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.666
Tsn control, this is trailblazer
119 requesting flight climb

233
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.930
to 40,000 feet
to clear weather. Copy?

234
00:12:40.107 --> 00:12:42.065
Comms here are not so good.

235
00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:43.545
Tcas is clear of traffic.

236
00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:48.245
Tsn control,
this is trailblazer 119.

237
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:51.466
Climbing to 40,000 to
clear weather, in the blind.

238
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:03.826
Trailblazer 119, clear to 40,000.

239
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:11.007
Copy, tsn. Trailblazer 119
level at 40,000.

240
00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:14.532
New year's crew, huh?

241
00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:20.756
Whoa.

242
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:25.326
What was that?

243
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.720
Okay.

244
00:13:28.764 --> 00:13:30.679
I'm gonna check
on the passengers.

245
00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:32.507
- You have control.
- I have control.

246
00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:38.469
Nothing to worry about, folks.

247
00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:39.514
Just some weather.

248
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.344
- Here, Bonnie. You okay?
- Oh. Yes.

249
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:48.044
What was that?

250
00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:50.873
Sorry, folks. Just going
through some weather.

251
00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:52.657
Is this yours?

252
00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:54.790
- That's mine.
- Oh. Here you go.

253
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.357
Thank you.

254
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.707
He's great with the jokes,
but can he fly the damn plane?

255
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.970
We're doing
the best we can, sir.

256
00:14:01.014 --> 00:14:02.624
Hey, can I at least get a towel?

257
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:05.714
We'll get you one
just as soon as we can.

258
00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:09.718
What happened? Are you okay?

259
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:11.328
Oh. All good.
Just a scratch.

260
00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:12.373
All right.

261
00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:14.917
Listen, keep everybody
in their seats.

262
00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:16.899
No exceptions. All right?

263
00:14:35.962 --> 00:14:37.224
Strap 'em in tight.

264
00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:38.573
Yes, sir.

265
00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:40.880
Bonnie,
stay in your seat.

266
00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:42.055
What's happening?

267
00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:45.972
Captain,
avionics are down.

268
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:55.416
- I have control.
- Copy that.

269
00:14:56.504 --> 00:14:59.159
- Check breakers and reset.
- Resetting.

270
00:15:00.377 --> 00:15:03.511
Tsn, this is trailblazer 119.
Do you copy?

271
00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:08.603
Unresponsive. There's no power.

272
00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:12.172
Avionics must be fried. Shit.

273
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.827
Is anyone on this channel?
Please respond.

274
00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:18.047
Trailblazer 119, flying blind.

275
00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:21.964
Lightning strike.
Avionics down. We are dark.

276
00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:23.835
Does anyone have our position?

277
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.796
Radio is dead. Resetting.

278
00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:33.845
System failure.

279
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.021
We're not transmitting.

280
00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:37.719
We're on straight battery.

281
00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:42.376
That gives us 10 minutes to put
her down before we lose power

282
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:44.421
and drop
into uncontrolled descent.

283
00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:52.864
Stopwatch.

284
00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:54.214
What?

285
00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:55.737
Call it out, dele.

286
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.217
One minute at a time, okay?

287
00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:01.134
- Okay?
- Okay.

288
00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:04.920
Okay. Manual nav.
Last marked position?

289
00:16:09.142 --> 00:16:12.275
427, south southwest of Manila,

290
00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.537
heading zero-three-zero.

291
00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:15.975
Given speed and heading,

292
00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:18.238
we should be about here.

293
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.180
The storm's heading northeast.

294
00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:24.331
We won't make Manila.

295
00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:28.857
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

296
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.340
This is trailblazer 119.
Descending from 40,000 feet.

297
00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:37.735
No radar, no navigation,
no antenna, no adi.

298
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:39.999
Please respond.

299
00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:43.045
Oh, my god.

300
00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:44.916
Avionics are fried, Bonnie.

301
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.266
It's about to get very rough.

302
00:16:47.528 --> 00:16:49.182
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:16:54.622 --> 00:16:55.927
This is not happening.

304
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:57.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had...

305
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:06.025
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
had an electrical malfunction

306
00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:09.985
and I need everyone to have
their seatbelts securely fastened!

307
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.466
We're gonna be forced to fly
through some severe weather!

308
00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:14.096
- What happened?
- An electrical malfunction!

309
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.040
I need everyone's seatbelts
to be fully fastened!

310
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:22.476
Captain.

311
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.572
- Time?
- Eight minutes.

312
00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:36.794
We're gonna lose the moon.
Keep your eyes on the gyro.

313
00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:38.231
Call it out.

314
00:17:38.274 --> 00:17:40.209
Get ready to take the controls
if anything happens.

315
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.071
That's hail.

316
00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:54.290
Now it's a party.

317
00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:58.164
Shit. We gotta
punch through this storm

318
00:17:58.207 --> 00:17:59.600
and see where we come out.

319
00:18:14.702 --> 00:18:18.009
My phone.

320
00:18:18.053 --> 00:18:20.055
- It's not going through.
- Neither is mine.

321
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:24.625
Come on, baby.
Hold tight. Hold tight.

322
00:18:24.668 --> 00:18:26.453
Oh, my god. Help!

323
00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:30.370
Can you take off the cuffs?
I can't swim.

324
00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:33.329
Not a chance.

325
00:18:40.684 --> 00:18:43.165
Go ahead, go ahead.
I got you. I got you.

326
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:45.254
The goddamn plane
is falling apart!

327
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:52.566
Shit!

328
00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:59.138
- Sir, you must take your seat.
- Sir? Sir? Sit down.

329
00:19:01.052 --> 00:19:02.837
Stay here. Stay here,
Isabella. Just stay.

330
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.075
- Just stay seated.
- Sit down!

331
00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:05.405
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

332
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.168
Isabella!

333
00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.413
Oh, my god!

334
00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:16.067
Whoa.

335
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.157
Could you help her?

336
00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:21.029
Time?

337
00:19:21.072 --> 00:19:22.267
Five minutes and forty seconds.

338
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:30.169
Come on.
Come on, break through.

339
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.260
Oh, fuck.

340
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.454
There you go.

341
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:00.764
Time?

342
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:02.288
Four minutes
and thirty seconds.

343
00:20:02.853 --> 00:20:03.854
Okay.

344
00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:06.117
Can you see land anywhere?

345
00:20:14.822 --> 00:20:16.215
Please, sir, sit down.

346
00:20:17.825 --> 00:20:19.783
Everyone stay
in their seats, please.

347
00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:35.277
Captain,
what do I tell the passengers?

348
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.067
Never thought
I would ever have to say this.

349
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.205
Prepare to ditch.

350
00:20:54.427 --> 00:20:55.471
Okay.

351
00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:02.435
Attention, everyone!

352
00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:05.133
I need you to brace for impact!

353
00:21:05.176 --> 00:21:07.614
The plane is equipped
with flotation devices.

354
00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:09.374
- We're gonna crash.
- And once we are down,

355
00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:11.574
I will give you
further instruction!

356
00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:13.073
- Maria, do you hear me?
- Where are we landing?

357
00:21:13.097 --> 00:21:15.796
Yes, copy that!
Brace for impact!

358
00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:21.845
Those white caps
don't look too welcoming.

359
00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:26.154
Time?

360
00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:29.113
Three minutes.

361
00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:57.272
All right, dele.
Let's give this our best shot.

362
00:21:58.926 --> 00:22:01.363
On my command,
we're gonna turn into the wind

363
00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:03.887
and we're gonna come in
parallel to the swells,

364
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:06.325
so we touch down slow and level.

365
00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:09.284
Okay?

366
00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:18.337
You see that? Over there?

367
00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:21.427
That's fucking land.

368
00:22:32.786 --> 00:22:35.354
Feet dry. Any clue where we are?

369
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:37.834
We should be somewhere
around here.

370
00:22:40.663 --> 00:22:42.012
Too low terrain.

371
00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:43.840
Too low terrain.

372
00:22:43.884 --> 00:22:45.276
That's still working.

373
00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:50.586
Captain, 90 seconds.

374
00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:54.024
She'll give us more.

375
00:23:04.513 --> 00:23:06.297
What's going on?

376
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:07.690
We can't be landing here.

377
00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:10.737
Twenty seconds.

378
00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:15.437
We might be better off
over the water.

379
00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:24.272
Out of time.

380
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.758
There!

381
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:33.847
That's a road. Time?

382
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.980
Ten seconds past zero.
Are you...

383
00:23:37.024 --> 00:23:38.504
That's a fucking road.

384
00:23:43.378 --> 00:23:45.206
- Flaps full.
- Flaps full.

385
00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:46.468
Fuel jettison.

386
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:51.473
Visually confirming fuel dump,
my side.

387
00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:52.866
Nothing here.

388
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:54.781
Right side failure.
Trying again.

389
00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:00.047
- Negative.
- Fuck.

390
00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:02.484
We're a stick of dynamite.

391
00:24:04.094 --> 00:24:05.705
Manually extend gear. Hurry.

392
00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:11.145
Landing gear extended
and locked.

393
00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:13.408
- Low terrain.
- Shut up.

394
00:24:19.719 --> 00:24:20.720
No. No.

395
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:21.938
Speed brakes extended.

396
00:24:21.982 --> 00:24:24.245
Reverse full thrust.
Reverse full thrust.

397
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:28.336
- Help me with the brakes, dele.
- On it.

398
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.321
Okay.

399
00:24:58.932 --> 00:25:00.847
Everything off.

400
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.374
How... how did you...

401
00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:12.511
One minute at a time.

402
00:25:13.381 --> 00:25:15.296
Right, dele?

403
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.822
Fuck.

404
00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:25.045
Hell, we still got fuel.

405
00:25:25.698 --> 00:25:27.438
And a hot plane.

406
00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:29.789
Let's get everyone off now.
Let's go.

407
00:25:29.832 --> 00:25:31.157
Dele,
get everybody in the front.

408
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:33.072
Get me the hell off
this damn plane.

409
00:25:33.096 --> 00:25:34.184
Everybody okay?

410
00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:36.317
Quiet, please.
Everybody, listen up!

411
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.841
I need everybody
off the plane now!

412
00:25:38.885 --> 00:25:40.408
Which way are we going?

413
00:25:40.451 --> 00:25:43.585
Everybody, quiet. Go to
the front. Go to the front.

414
00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:46.457
I need you all
off this plane now!

415
00:25:48.764 --> 00:25:50.418
I just wanna know what...

416
00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:53.789
- Don't worry about your stuff.
- You need to breathe.

417
00:25:53.813 --> 00:25:55.118
Get moved to the front.

418
00:25:55.162 --> 00:25:56.163
Okay, just breathe.

419
00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:58.513
- Bonnie?
- Two!

420
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:01.124
We have two. Sir, two.

421
00:26:01.168 --> 00:26:03.474
- Okay, just go.
- Okay, come on. Move, move.

422
00:26:03.518 --> 00:26:05.912
Let's calmly exit the plane.

423
00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:08.262
Everybody, stay calm.
Let me through.

424
00:26:08.305 --> 00:26:10.003
- Hurry, Bonnie.
- Oh, yes.

425
00:26:10.046 --> 00:26:11.918
In a single line,
come on through. Come on.

426
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:14.094
Be calm! Go! Move, move.

427
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.380
Please move to the side.
Please move to the side.

428
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:32.286
Okay, sit down.
Fold your arms, like this.

429
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:35.376
Arms crossed, sit down.

430
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.097
- Flight 119.
- Uh, I'll call you.

431
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:02.838
What do we know, Sydney?

432
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:06.233
Well, sir, we lost it
somewhere west of the Philippines.

433
00:27:06.276 --> 00:27:08.714
- Lost?
- The plane requested a higher altitude

434
00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.411
at 5:16 A.M. local.

435
00:27:10.454 --> 00:27:13.849
Nineteen minutes, 23 seconds
later, all communication stopped.

436
00:27:13.893 --> 00:27:17.897
Manila atc had them on radar
until 5:43 A.M. local

437
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.683
when the plane dipped below
20,000 feet and lost all contact.

438
00:27:21.727 --> 00:27:23.685
Get me David scarsdale,
right now.

439
00:27:23.729 --> 00:27:25.513
Um, we have some cuts
and bruises,

440
00:27:25.556 --> 00:27:27.863
but, um, I think everyone's
just pretty rattled.

441
00:27:27.907 --> 00:27:29.386
Anyone have cell service?

442
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.431
No. No one.

443
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.652
What do we do
about the prisoner?

444
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:35.349
I don't know. That's
a new one for me.

445
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.265
Um...

446
00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:41.616
I saw him eyeing the
officer's keys, so I took them.

447
00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:43.226
Is he dangerous?

448
00:27:46.882 --> 00:27:48.841
He's being extradited
on a murder charge.

449
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:51.887
The officer...

450
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:53.889
The officer said, yeah,
he might be dangerous.

451
00:27:56.022 --> 00:27:57.980
Look, we just keep an eye on him

452
00:27:58.024 --> 00:28:02.028
and keep him separate
from the other passengers, okay?

453
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.203
Just try your best.

454
00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:04.639
- Okay.
- All right.

455
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.815
Here. I think
you should hold on to these.

456
00:28:08.948 --> 00:28:10.514
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

457
00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:11.646
Yeah, okay.

458
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:14.344
Water... just nowhere.

459
00:28:16.042 --> 00:28:17.933
- What's going on?
- Tell us something.

460
00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:19.610
Yeah.
We need information.

461
00:28:19.654 --> 00:28:21.482
Can we please
get some real answers?

462
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:23.895
- There's gotta be some thing...
- Okay, everybody...

463
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:26.966
Everybody... listen, listen up.

464
00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:29.751
I want to thank you all
for your cooperation.

465
00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:31.207
I'm sorry for what
we just had to go through,

466
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:32.798
and I know
you all have questions.

467
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:33.973
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

468
00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:35.191
So, here's the situation.

469
00:28:36.845 --> 00:28:38.760
We got hit by lightning

470
00:28:38.804 --> 00:28:41.763
and our main power
and comms are down.

471
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:44.026
Okay, so, as of now,

472
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.549
there's no way
of calling for help.

473
00:28:45.593 --> 00:28:48.378
- What? You're kidding.
- No way? No way?

474
00:28:48.422 --> 00:28:51.077
What I need everybody
to do right now, listen up...

475
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.732
- How come?
- Is remain calm.

476
00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:55.777
All right? Once the plane
cools down,

477
00:28:55.821 --> 00:28:58.432
we're gonna get back on there,
we're gonna get our things,

478
00:28:58.475 --> 00:28:59.999
get some water

479
00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:01.672
and we're gonna figure out
what we're gonna do.

480
00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:03.132
Do you know where we are?

481
00:29:03.176 --> 00:29:06.135
Yeah, we think
that we're near davao

482
00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:07.397
in the southern Philippines.

483
00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:10.052
- You think?
- We think.

484
00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:12.620
- Very reassuring.
- Rest assured,

485
00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:15.318
me and the crew are gonna do
everything we can to make sure

486
00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.756
that we get you
out of here safely.

487
00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:20.280
All right? Okay. Thank you.

488
00:29:20.323 --> 00:29:21.977
Okay, come on.

489
00:29:24.153 --> 00:29:25.676
- Hey, Terry.
- Hey.

490
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.461
Everyone,
this is David scarsdale.

491
00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:30.725
He specializes in corporate
strategy and crisis management.

492
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.119
- Happy new year.
- Let's hope so.

493
00:29:33.162 --> 00:29:34.685
Is this
the last point of contact?

494
00:29:34.729 --> 00:29:35.774
Yes, it is.

495
00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:37.186
That's a hell of a storm.

496
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.864
What idiot sent them
flying through that?

497
00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:40.691
It's airline protocol.

498
00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:42.824
Flight was light. It was
the most efficient route.

499
00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:44.565
I thought
they could fly above it.

500
00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:47.437
You thought? What, are you
a fucking meteorologist, too?

501
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:48.743
How much fuel did you save?

502
00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.484
About $12,000.

503
00:29:50.527 --> 00:29:53.356
Well, congratulations. That's
barely tip money on this deal.

504
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.881
The clock is ticking.
Every minute matters.

505
00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:58.361
If that plane ditched at sea,
or crash landed,

506
00:29:58.405 --> 00:30:01.625
we can count those minutes
in lives lost or saved. Got it?

507
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:04.715
Okay, so, what can I do?
Call the military? Us assets?

508
00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:05.934
What are your best options?

509
00:30:05.978 --> 00:30:07.936
Well, in that part of the world,

510
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.895
there's only one option
right now.

511
00:30:09.938 --> 00:30:11.070
What's that?

512
00:30:11.113 --> 00:30:12.308
You're gonna want
the lawyers out of here.

513
00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:13.812
It's fine. Tell me.

514
00:30:14.943 --> 00:30:17.250
Private assets.
I'm already into it.

515
00:30:17.293 --> 00:30:19.774
- Mercenaries?
- Terry...

516
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.907
The Philippines
are not the amalfi coast.

517
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.692
Now, I need a group working
on press releases

518
00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:26.955
for every possible scenario.

519
00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:29.305
A ghosting like Malaysia 370.

520
00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:31.873
A crash landing
with no survivors.

521
00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:33.701
A hijacking with demands.

522
00:30:33.744 --> 00:30:36.486
If you have plans for new
year's Eve, I just canceled them.

523
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.880
A little further.
Yeah, right to the end.

524
00:30:38.924 --> 00:30:41.274
- Tight as we can.
- Yeah.

525
00:30:41.317 --> 00:30:43.363
Why can't we just stay inside
the plane?

526
00:30:43.406 --> 00:30:46.235
It's safe and dry.

527
00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:48.672
Well, that's a good question,
mister, uh...

528
00:30:48.716 --> 00:30:50.936
Sinclair. Matt sinclair.

529
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:53.895
Well, without air conditioning,

530
00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:55.854
that plane
is gonna cook in the sun.

531
00:30:57.464 --> 00:31:02.208
So, we're better off out here,
with the shelter and a breeze.

532
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:04.906
Hey, while you're there,
you wanna step in,

533
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.083
help secure that, Matt sinclair?

534
00:31:08.127 --> 00:31:10.390
Okay, if you're in your bags,
you find anything like,

535
00:31:10.433 --> 00:31:13.219
uh, bug spray, sunscreen,

536
00:31:13.262 --> 00:31:16.091
food, please share. All right?

537
00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:20.966
Mr. Gaspare.

538
00:31:28.582 --> 00:31:29.583
Well...

539
00:31:31.193 --> 00:31:33.674
Looks like we've got ourselves
in a bit of a mess here.

540
00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.767
And so,

541
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.944
I'm not quite sure what
we're supposed to do with you.

542
00:31:42.988 --> 00:31:45.338
To be honest, I'm a bit
surprised you're still here.

543
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.752
You think I'm fucking stupid
enough to try and escape

544
00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.212
in a jungle I don't know?

545
00:31:51.561 --> 00:31:52.606
In handcuffs?

546
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:54.913
Unless you're offering.

547
00:31:57.872 --> 00:31:59.004
I don't think I can do that.

548
00:32:01.397 --> 00:32:03.008
Then we have
nothing to talk about.

549
00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:15.150
Shit.

550
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.329
This is what happens
when a 40-amp fuse

551
00:32:20.373 --> 00:32:22.375
gets hit with enough juice
to light a city.

552
00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:24.551
Check it out, man.

553
00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:29.512
What about the radio?

554
00:32:32.211 --> 00:32:34.735
Let's see here. Oh, no.

555
00:32:35.649 --> 00:32:37.303
It's fried, melted.

556
00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:38.391
And the transponder?

557
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:42.351
It's hard to tell
without the power.

558
00:32:48.053 --> 00:32:50.577
If we could reroute
the isolation bus

559
00:32:51.491 --> 00:32:52.709
to the essential bus,

560
00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.800
we could draw down more amps
from the battery.

561
00:32:57.453 --> 00:32:58.498
In theory.

562
00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:02.850
Captain, plane's fully unloaded

563
00:33:02.893 --> 00:33:05.940
except for the, uh,
bodies and their personals.

564
00:33:09.944 --> 00:33:11.467
- I'll handle it.
- Okay.

565
00:33:12.251 --> 00:33:14.340
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Yeah?

566
00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:15.602
Sorry about Isabella.

567
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:17.898
- What are you doing, man?
- You know what they say.

568
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:19.943
No video, didn't happen.

569
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:25.645
Here we all are.
Alone, in the jungle.

570
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.735
No idea of how
we're gonna get out.

571
00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:33.000
Survivors of the worst
fucking plane ride

572
00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:35.133
in the history
of bad plane rides.

573
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:38.136
There's our lovely plane that
decided to fall out of the sky.

574
00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:43.097
Trailblazer.
Never flying this again.

575
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.491
There's our snacks.
They're gonna last us

576
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:47.928
about an hour.

577
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:49.059
Zero-sixteen.

578
00:35:49.103 --> 00:35:52.367
Carried that course
for 13 minutes.

579
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:54.935
So, assuming
the transponder went down

580
00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:56.458
with the lightning strike...

581
00:35:56.502 --> 00:35:57.633
Let's do the math.

582
00:35:57.677 --> 00:36:00.941
That's 17 minutes,
300 miles per hour.

583
00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:02.551
So, multiplying
that out, that's...

584
00:36:04.118 --> 00:36:05.641
Shit.

585
00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:09.123
That's over a thousand
square miles' search radius.

586
00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.256
It'll take a miracle
to find us here.

587
00:36:11.299 --> 00:36:14.041
Captain. This island here? Jolo?

588
00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.175
It's very, very bad.

589
00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.395
- What...
- It's run

590
00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:22.484
by separatists and criminals.

591
00:36:22.528 --> 00:36:24.356
There's no government or police.

592
00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:27.141
If this is where we landed,
we're not safe.

593
00:36:30.797 --> 00:36:31.972
All right, we tell Bonnie.

594
00:36:34.235 --> 00:36:36.194
But let's keep this
to ourselves for now.

595
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:41.068
And then there's this guy,
Mr. Mysterious.

596
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.201
Very friendly.

597
00:36:44.376 --> 00:36:47.161
- No, no, no.
- Captain!

598
00:36:49.903 --> 00:36:51.774
Keep me out
of your fucking videos!

599
00:36:57.519 --> 00:37:00.305
Hey, did you hit
your head? Are you okay?

600
00:37:00.348 --> 00:37:01.804
Maria, can you please
get the medic bag?

601
00:37:01.828 --> 00:37:02.829
Yep.

602
00:37:10.489 --> 00:37:13.231
I'm gonna need you to do an
on-camera hit for the press, Terry.

603
00:37:13.274 --> 00:37:16.146
We'll have a statement prepared,
but you'll need to take questions, too.

604
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.037
Shouldn't we wait till we know
a little bit more?

605
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.735
If we wait until we know more, it
looks like you're hiding something.

606
00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:21.040
Just show
your concern, be humble.

607
00:37:21.064 --> 00:37:22.414
- You know the drill.
- Got it.

608
00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:26.113
Here you go.

609
00:37:26.156 --> 00:37:27.941
You, Mr. Fuckin' weatherman.

610
00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:30.073
Time to redeem yourself.

611
00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:31.858
I need everything
on that aircraft.

612
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:33.555
Flight times, maintenance logs.

613
00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.775
Names of the techs
who last serviced the plane.

614
00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:37.646
- Everything.
- Yes, sir. Got it.

615
00:38:00.103 --> 00:38:01.263
You sure about this, captain?

616
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.020
No.

617
00:38:04.064 --> 00:38:05.761
But we're running pretty low
on options.

618
00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:09.852
Look, I'm not tying him up.

619
00:38:11.811 --> 00:38:13.931
If he runs, at least he's away
from the others, right?

620
00:38:25.433 --> 00:38:26.608
All right.

621
00:38:26.652 --> 00:38:28.436
Let's go and break it
to the others.

622
00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:38.533
All right, everybody. Listen up.

623
00:38:38.577 --> 00:38:39.795
So, here's our situation.

624
00:38:40.927 --> 00:38:42.798
Mr. Dele and I,
from our calculations,

625
00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:45.714
we believe that we have landed
on an island

626
00:38:45.758 --> 00:38:47.803
somewhere in the sulu cluster.

627
00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:49.327
We don't know which island.

628
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.373
The problem is the area
between where the transponder

629
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:56.246
was struck by lightning
to here is so vast

630
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.901
that search and rescue
could take some time.

631
00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:00.314
- Jesus Christ.
- How long is it gonna take?

632
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.775
We're also gonna have to ration
food and water.

633
00:39:02.818 --> 00:39:04.646
What's your next move?
Smoke signals?

634
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:05.995
Can you just keep it
to yourself?

635
00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.538
Cut him a break.
At least he landed the plane.

636
00:39:07.562 --> 00:39:08.694
We didn't crash.

637
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:10.019
We're in the middle
of nowhere though.

638
00:39:10.043 --> 00:39:11.542
- We're stranded.
- Yeah, come on, man.

639
00:39:11.566 --> 00:39:14.003
We didn't crash, man.

640
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:17.180
Listen, last night, we
flew over some kind of facility.

641
00:39:17.224 --> 00:39:20.532
I'm hoping they have a phone
or a radio.

642
00:39:20.575 --> 00:39:22.403
If I can get there,
make contact,

643
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.753
we could be rescued in hours.

644
00:39:25.972 --> 00:39:28.409
Until then, I need everybody
to be careful

645
00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:30.716
because we don't know
what's going on in that jungle.

646
00:39:30.759 --> 00:39:32.215
- I'll go with you.
- I will come, too.

647
00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.632
I appreciate it.

648
00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:36.243
But Mr. Gaspare
has kindly volunteered to come.

649
00:39:36.286 --> 00:39:37.375
What?

650
00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:38.830
You're taking a guy
in handcuffs?

651
00:39:38.854 --> 00:39:40.421
Makes sense.

652
00:40:02.574 --> 00:40:03.575
Come on.

653
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:38.436
Datu!

654
00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:41.134
Datu!

655
00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:45.094
Datu!

656
00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:37.146
Well, we're doing everything
we possibly can

657
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:39.540
to find flight 119,
sparing no expense.

658
00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:42.369
Have you determined
that the plane has crashed?

659
00:41:42.412 --> 00:41:44.545
Uh, no, that's not
the assumption.

660
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:46.349
- We have very little...
- You sure it's dad's flight?

661
00:41:46.373 --> 00:41:47.959
- We are coordinating...
- I'm sure.

662
00:41:47.983 --> 00:41:49.308
The search and rescue
efforts in the region.

663
00:41:49.332 --> 00:41:50.595
No.

664
00:41:50.638 --> 00:41:52.292
As soon as we have
some updates,

665
00:41:52.335 --> 00:41:54.773
hopefully some positive news,
we'll get right back to you.

666
00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.002
I peeked through
your officer's bag for supplies.

667
00:42:08.743 --> 00:42:11.050
I came across your pocketknife.

668
00:42:11.093 --> 00:42:13.443
You former military
or something'?

669
00:42:13.487 --> 00:42:15.271
Groupe des
commandos parachutistes.

670
00:42:16.925 --> 00:42:18.057
French foreign legion.

671
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:20.494
Pay and benefits suck,

672
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:22.583
but they don't ask any questions
if you can hack it.

673
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:24.585
Questions?

674
00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:26.674
Nothing's black
and white, captain.

675
00:42:26.718 --> 00:42:29.372
I was just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

676
00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:30.736
No one cares
what really happened.

677
00:42:31.592 --> 00:42:34.987
I was 18 and fucked.

678
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:39.078
So, rather than, uh, rot in
prison, I ran, joined the legion.

679
00:42:40.122 --> 00:42:41.820
End of story.

680
00:42:41.863 --> 00:42:42.983
How'd you get caught?

681
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.390
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

682
00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:52.091
Now let me ask you something.

683
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.224
Did you bring my knife?

684
00:42:57.662 --> 00:42:58.663
Sorry, no.

685
00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:00.752
I left it in the bag.

686
00:43:02.275 --> 00:43:03.581
How about
the dead officer's gun?

687
00:43:12.459 --> 00:43:14.548
We should
be getting close about now.

688
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:29.215
Brodie torrance.

689
00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:31.957
Scottish, UK citizen.
Royal air force.

690
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.741
Then flew commercial
for 20 years.

691
00:43:33.785 --> 00:43:36.526
New York to London,
Paris, Tokyo. Hot-shit routes.

692
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.834
Since then, he's been flying
Egypt, meridiana, frontier

693
00:43:39.878 --> 00:43:42.576
and trailblazer,
flying shit third-tier routes.

694
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.144
- Why? What happened?
- Check the video file.

695
00:43:46.493 --> 00:43:48.147
Hey, where's my drink?

696
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.341
- Oh, Jesus.
- I asked you for a drink,

697
00:43:49.365 --> 00:43:50.497
like, 10 minutes ago.

698
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.648
What do you want?
Get out of here.

699
00:43:51.672 --> 00:43:52.804
Hey, hey, hey!

700
00:43:52.847 --> 00:43:54.327
What the hell is going...

701
00:44:02.117 --> 00:44:03.641
Can this get any worse?

702
00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:10.169
That's right. That's right.

703
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:12.780
I like this guy.

704
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:36.717
Holy shit.

705
00:46:20.647 --> 00:46:22.736
Fuck. Okay.

706
00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.840
John shellback,
it's David scarsdale.

707
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.354
What's your status?

708
00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:35.357
We're prepping to load now.
Should be in the air 0900.

709
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:38.317
Please, scardy, tell me
we're going back to Macau.

710
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.059
File a flight plan for Manila,

711
00:46:41.102 --> 00:46:42.756
and we'll see
how things shake out.

712
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.342
Are you telling me
you have no idea

713
00:46:44.366 --> 00:46:45.715
where this plane actually is?

714
00:46:45.759 --> 00:46:47.282
It's not in Macau.
I can tell you that.

715
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:52.984
That's gonna be extra, scardy.
That's going to be extra.

716
00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.507
Happy fuckin' new year.

717
00:46:54.986 --> 00:46:55.987
Out.

718
00:46:58.206 --> 00:46:59.729
They're on their way.

719
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:01.490
They'll reach the area
in about three hours,

720
00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:03.559
then parachute in once
we get the plane's location.

721
00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:09.217
So, how much
in the emergency fund?

722
00:47:09.261 --> 00:47:10.523
Half million.

723
00:47:10.566 --> 00:47:12.699
Great. That might be enough
to get one of us

724
00:47:12.742 --> 00:47:14.788
- out of Indonesian prison.
- Here.

725
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:18.096
- Are we good, boys?
- Good now. There you go, boss.

726
00:47:29.237 --> 00:47:30.543
One, eight...

727
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.211
Welcome
to trailblazer airlines.

728
00:47:46.254 --> 00:47:48.996
- This is Carmen.
- Carmen, listen carefully.

729
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.824
This is an emergency.

730
00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:55.655
I'm captain Brodie torrance.
Trailblazer 119.

731
00:47:55.698 --> 00:47:59.093
We've gone down on an island
in the sulu sea.

732
00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:00.244
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

733
00:48:00.268 --> 00:48:03.315
My name
is captain Brodie torrance.

734
00:48:03.358 --> 00:48:06.361
And I'm the captain
of trailblazer 119.

735
00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:09.277
Now, we've gone down.
We made a crash landing on...

736
00:48:09.321 --> 00:48:10.713
Sir, we've been
getting crank calls

737
00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:12.672
- all day about this.
- No. Hello?

738
00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:14.543
I hear you. I'm here.

739
00:48:14.587 --> 00:48:16.652
Now, I need you to patch me
through to emergency ops immediately.

740
00:48:16.676 --> 00:48:18.610
Listen, we've been getting
calls all day about this.

741
00:48:18.634 --> 00:48:20.549
- Just shut up and listen.
- Calm down, sir.

742
00:48:20.593 --> 00:48:22.160
- We've been getting...
- Sorry.

743
00:48:22.203 --> 00:48:24.597
Crank calls all day long
about this disappearance.

744
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.121
Now, can you tell me
your employee badge number.

745
00:48:27.992 --> 00:48:30.559
Fuck.

746
00:48:30.603 --> 00:48:33.649
I don't actually have
my badge on me, Carmen.

747
00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:35.845
- I need you to believe me on this.
- Sir, without your badge...

748
00:48:35.869 --> 00:48:37.218
- Carmen.
- Sir...

749
00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:38.848
- Can you hear what I'm saying?
- I can hear you.

750
00:48:38.872 --> 00:48:40.676
- Our flight has gone down.
- Without your badge number...

751
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.702
I'm the captain of trail...

752
00:48:43.224 --> 00:48:44.225
Hello?

753
00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:53.104
Nail the badge
to my fucking head.

754
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:00.807
All right, Daniela.

755
00:49:01.547 --> 00:49:02.548
Don't let me down.

756
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.164
Hello?

757
00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:13.689
Daniela? Thank god.

758
00:49:15.039 --> 00:49:17.432
Hey, can you hear me?

759
00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:19.695
- Now, listen. Don't...
- Dad? Is that you?

760
00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:21.697
- Yes, sweetheart. It's me.
- You're okay?

761
00:49:21.741 --> 00:49:23.351
- Dad.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

762
00:49:23.395 --> 00:49:26.615
Now, don't talk. Just listen,
'cause we might cut out, okay?

763
00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:28.356
Quick. Grab something
to write with.

764
00:49:30.358 --> 00:49:32.317
- Dani?
- Not now, aunt Carrie.

765
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.754
- Is that your dad? Dani.
- Yes, yes!

766
00:49:34.797 --> 00:49:37.017
- Where are you, Brodie?
- Okay, I got it.

767
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:38.976
We've gone down, all right?

768
00:49:39.019 --> 00:49:42.370
I want you to write what I say,
and get it to trailblazer immediately.

769
00:49:42.414 --> 00:49:44.024
Okay.

770
00:49:44.068 --> 00:49:47.680
All right, we're on an island
somewhere in the jolo cluster

771
00:49:47.723 --> 00:49:49.247
in the sulu sea.

772
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.423
Now, we have no radio.

773
00:49:51.466 --> 00:49:52.990
And I don't know
what island we're on.

774
00:49:55.122 --> 00:49:56.384
Wait, no, stop!

775
00:49:56.428 --> 00:49:57.951
- Dad!
- Wait!

776
00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:01.727
Oh, fuck.

777
00:52:23.879 --> 00:52:24.924
Fuck.

778
00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:50.950
You can come out, captain.

779
00:52:52.473 --> 00:52:53.561
I'm not gonna hurt you.

780
00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:10.709
Drink it all. Hurry.
We gotta move.

781
00:53:13.668 --> 00:53:14.669
Are you okay?

782
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.238
No.

783
00:53:18.282 --> 00:53:19.762
Would you rather
that be you?

784
00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.590
- No.
- That's it, then.

785
00:53:23.548 --> 00:53:24.549
You Bury it all.

786
00:53:25.637 --> 00:53:26.725
Deal with shit later.

787
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:30.642
Reach anyone?

788
00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:33.906
Yes.

789
00:53:35.124 --> 00:53:36.343
But we can't depend on it.

790
00:53:37.083 --> 00:53:38.171
I got cut off.

791
00:53:54.318 --> 00:53:55.319
It's loaded.

792
00:53:56.145 --> 00:53:57.234
Slip the safety and shoot.

793
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.710
Lucky for you,
I snuck up on these guys.

794
00:54:34.923 --> 00:54:36.838
I got a feeling
we're gonna see a lot more.

795
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:50.243
Hey. Hey. Come here.

796
00:55:05.389 --> 00:55:06.433
Look.

797
00:55:18.793 --> 00:55:20.273
Hey, they've got passports here.

798
00:55:28.412 --> 00:55:29.717
Filipino, UK.

799
00:55:41.773 --> 00:55:43.133
Hey, torrance.

800
00:55:46.255 --> 00:55:47.300
Look here.

801
00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:57.179
Mark and Maria Burnham.

802
00:55:57.223 --> 00:56:00.618
Missionaries with
the good samaritan fellowship.

803
00:56:01.227 --> 00:56:02.707
Holy shit.

804
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:05.666
$200,000 needs to be prepared
in cash by tomorrow.

805
00:56:07.102 --> 00:56:09.714
They say instructions
to follow for that

806
00:56:09.757 --> 00:56:12.369
by tomorrow or they're...
They're gonna kill us.

807
00:56:16.982 --> 00:56:18.375
I gotta get to the passengers.

808
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:32.171
Ah, shit.

809
00:56:35.827 --> 00:56:37.002
Come on.

810
00:57:17.259 --> 00:57:18.826
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

811
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:21.829
Someone's coming.

812
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:40.065
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey, hey!

813
00:57:40.108 --> 00:57:41.849
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

814
00:57:41.893 --> 00:57:44.199
We're here.
Yes! We're here!

815
00:57:44.243 --> 00:57:45.462
Hey, get back. Get back!

816
00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:48.484
Get back, get back.
We don't know who it is.

817
00:57:48.508 --> 00:57:49.683
We don't know who it is.

818
00:57:49.727 --> 00:57:50.834
- Get back! Get back in!
- Come on.

819
00:57:50.858 --> 00:57:52.338
- Hey, hey!
- Stop!

820
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.659
Hear that? Stop the truck.

821
00:58:10.182 --> 00:58:11.183
What?

822
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.104
What the fuck
is the matter with...

823
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:24.588
Oh, shit.

824
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.760
Where is captain?

825
00:58:54.792 --> 00:58:56.010
I'm in charge.

826
00:59:00.406 --> 00:59:01.538
Hey, hey.

827
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:09.981
Give list. Passenger list.

828
00:59:11.286 --> 00:59:13.811
Oh, shit. Yeah,
I've gotta go in there.

829
00:59:13.854 --> 00:59:15.574
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
No, wait, wait, wait.

830
00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:22.080
Passenger list.

831
00:59:37.617 --> 00:59:39.053
Captain Brodie torrance?

832
00:59:43.536 --> 00:59:44.656
Captain torrance isn't here.

833
00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:46.974
Where is he?

834
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.590
Where is he?

835
00:59:53.633 --> 00:59:55.592
Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop.

836
00:59:59.944 --> 01:00:03.425
He went...
He went looking for help.

837
01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:04.664
- Help where?
- I don't know!

838
01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:06.167
Just a phone, a radio!

839
01:00:07.995 --> 01:00:10.084
So, no one know you're here?

840
01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:19.137
No!

841
01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:40.593
Oh.

842
01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.901
Oh, my god.

843
01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:49.733
Passport.

844
01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.791
Get on bus, now!

845
01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:09.056
Go! Move!

846
01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.324
Move!

847
01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:21.416
No, no, no, no, no.

848
01:01:52.665 --> 01:01:54.623
Fuck is wrong with you?

849
01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:56.060
What the fuck is your problem?

850
01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:58.802
What the fuck were you gonna do?
It's a fucking army.

851
01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:18.449
We can still find out
where they are.

852
01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:20.800
They're gonna know
where they are.

853
01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:22.260
Then what? Oh, god.

854
01:02:22.303 --> 01:02:23.914
- They're gonna know.
- The fuck?

855
01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:27.221
- Hey!
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

856
01:02:32.966 --> 01:02:34.533
Don't fucking move.

857
01:02:39.146 --> 01:02:41.235
- You speak English?
- Yes. Yes.

858
01:02:42.454 --> 01:02:44.301
- Little. Little.
- Empty your pockets.

859
01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:46.284
- Come on.
- Okay.

860
01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:47.527
Hands over your head.

861
01:02:53.421 --> 01:02:54.727
Who's that?

862
01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.902
Datu junmar.

863
01:02:57.425 --> 01:02:58.818
He in charge.

864
01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:01.342
"Datu" means "chief."

865
01:03:01.386 --> 01:03:03.257
Where's he taking them?

866
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:05.825
Hey! Where's he taking them?

867
01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.175
I tell you, datu kill me.

868
01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:11.439
- Kill my family.
- Me or datu?

869
01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:15.443
Dandulit village.

870
01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:20.927
Where is he keeping them
in dandulit?

871
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.408
Come on. Come on!

872
01:03:25.758 --> 01:03:29.240
Warehouse, on the river.
Then boat takes.

873
01:03:31.068 --> 01:03:32.547
Boat takes 'em where?

874
01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:33.810
I don't know.

875
01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:35.768
Where? Fucking tell me where.

876
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.990
- Tell me. Come on!
- I don't know!

877
01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:41.556
Whatever datu say, we do.

878
01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:46.561
I gotta go after them.

879
01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:49.651
And do what? We should wait.

880
01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:51.871
You said you made contact.

881
01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.525
I don't know
how much got through.

882
01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:55.744
And I'm not waiting here
to find out.

883
01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:59.357
They're my passengers.
They're my responsibility.

884
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.663
You don't have to come.
I'm not expecting you to.

885
01:04:01.707 --> 01:04:04.797
And I'm the
captain of trailblazer 119.

886
01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.931
Now, we've gone down.
We made a crash landing on...

887
01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:09.299
Sir,
we've been getting crank calls

888
01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:10.890
- all day about this.
- No. Hello?

889
01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:12.326
I hear you. I'm here.

890
01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:13.434
Now, I need you
to patch me through

891
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.329
to emergency ops immediately.

892
01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:17.351
Listen, we've been
getting calls all day about this.

893
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.613
- Just shut up and listen.
- Calm down, sir.

894
01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:20.726
After that call was cut off,

895
01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:23.337
torrance phoned his daughter,
Daniela, in Maui.

896
01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:25.905
She confirmed the details
of the recording.

897
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.361
And she said he told her
they went down

898
01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.691
somewhere in
the jolo island cluster.

899
01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:33.521
I need key hole satellite access
to this area to find that plane.

900
01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:34.827
Our assets are going airborne,

901
01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.220
and we'll circle
the jolo cluster

902
01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:37.656
until we get them
a drop location.

903
01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:38.894
But I need you
to call in some favors

904
01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.354
- and make it happen.
- Got it.

905
01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:02.637
Good job, dele.

906
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:48.466
Passen...

907
01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:31.988
Dandulit village
is one road in, one road out.

908
01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:36.644
Is this any use to me?

909
01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:38.646
You speak tagalog?

910
01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:55.291
Yeah, she's plugging it in now.

911
01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:56.882
Wait, I got... I think...

912
01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:58.164
- We got it. We got it.
- We're there.

913
01:06:58.188 --> 01:07:00.190
Found it. Dave, found the plane.

914
01:07:01.278 --> 01:07:04.020
Jolo island. Torrance was right.
Stand by.

915
01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:08.676
And there it is.

916
01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.809
Can't believe
it's intact.

917
01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:12.854
Sending the coordinates
to our assets now.

918
01:07:12.898 --> 01:07:14.813
They'll drop on-site asap.

919
01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.075
Well, there's really no need.

920
01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:17.531
They'll contact
the philippine government.

921
01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:19.078
Surely, they'll send
local authorities

922
01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:21.317
- with a search and rescue.
- It won't be that easy, Terry.

923
01:07:21.341 --> 01:07:22.647
- Why?
- Because there is

924
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.170
no authority on jolo island.

925
01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:25.911
It's run by separatists
and militias.

926
01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:27.869
The Filipino army
won't even go there anymore.

927
01:07:27.913 --> 01:07:30.437
They got their asses kicked
so many times.

928
01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:32.700
Look, the guys
will parachute in.

929
01:07:32.744 --> 01:07:35.007
But they're gonna need some help
getting everyone out.

930
01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:48.803
The village is two kilometers
in that direction.

931
01:07:48.847 --> 01:07:50.718
You know you can't
just ask for them back.

932
01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:53.156
Yeah, well,
you're the military man.

933
01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:54.853
I was hoping
you'd have some ideas.

934
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.378
Ah, man.

935
01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:03.035
Thank you... For helping.

936
01:08:12.523 --> 01:08:14.394
A priest in the legion
used to say,

937
01:08:14.438 --> 01:08:17.180
"redemption can only be found
in the most unusual places."

938
01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:20.226
Well, this certainly qualifies.

939
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.752
Ing

940
01:08:36.373 --> 01:08:38.505
Wait. Hey, hey. Hey, stop!

941
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:39.854
Stop! What are you doing?

942
01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.160
Yeah, hey, stop!

943
01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:45.773
Come. Come on.
Come here. Come on.

944
01:08:50.213 --> 01:08:52.040
- Come, come, come.
- No. No!

945
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:02.312
Name. Country.

946
01:09:02.355 --> 01:09:03.791
Oh!

947
01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:05.053
Name! Country!

948
01:09:05.097 --> 01:09:06.707
Maxwell carver, england.

949
01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:08.753
Name. Country.

950
01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:10.146
Brie Taylor, American.

951
01:09:11.495 --> 01:09:12.974
Name. Country.

952
01:09:14.324 --> 01:09:15.542
Oh!

953
01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:17.936
Name! Country!

954
01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.243
Matt sinclair, American!

955
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.463
Name. Country.

956
01:09:24.595 --> 01:09:25.987
Katie dhar, Sweden.

957
01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:28.381
Name. Country.

958
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.427
Samuel dele, Hong Kong.

959
01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.788
Shellback. Two dead jundies.

960
01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.659
Roger that. Set security.

961
01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:47.835
Go police up the chutes.
Get them out the open.

962
01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:50.055
Trailblazer cp,
this is shellback 6.

963
01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.230
How copy?

964
01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.232
We got you on comms, shellback.

965
01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:55.103
Getting your visual up now.

966
01:09:58.019 --> 01:10:00.196
Let's check
the plane. Check. On you.

967
01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:07.638
Yeah, Terry here.

968
01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:10.554
What do you mean, "no?"

969
01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:20.085
We've got two bodies
in the rear galley.

970
01:10:20.738 --> 01:10:21.826
Give us a look.

971
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:33.794
Shit.

972
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.500
Looks like it might be
crew members.

973
01:10:43.543 --> 01:10:45.806
Did you properly convey
the urgency of the situation?

974
01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:48.287
- Zip 'em up. We got 'em.
- That's unacceptable.

975
01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:52.030
That is unacceptable.
You tell 'em I said that.

976
01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:55.686
Filipinos won't send
a rescue team

977
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:57.383
without a battalion
of troops in support.

978
01:10:57.427 --> 01:10:58.732
They're saying 24 hours.

979
01:10:58.776 --> 01:10:59.777
True to form.

980
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.694
Any sign of the passengers
or the rest of the crew?

981
01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:05.217
That's a negative, boss.

982
01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.001
At least from
what I see right now.

983
01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.888
Shit.

984
01:11:23.931 --> 01:11:26.499
Trailblazer cp,
you're seeing this, right?

985
01:11:26.543 --> 01:11:29.415
Looks like we may have a
hostage situation on our hands.

986
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:42.289
You see the boats?

987
01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:44.561
They're fueling them up.

988
01:11:44.604 --> 01:11:45.823
Shit.

989
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:48.608
Taking them off the island.

990
01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:52.046
Once they're gone, that's it.

991
01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:32.391
We have to do this quietly.

992
01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:34.480
No guns until
we absolutely have to.

993
01:12:37.788 --> 01:12:40.312
That's it? That's your plan?

994
01:12:41.531 --> 01:12:42.662
You got a better one?

995
01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:10.255
Oh, shit.

996
01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:15.956
That's him. That's junmar.

997
01:13:17.349 --> 01:13:19.133
That's the bus.

998
01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:20.396
They gotta be in that house.

999
01:13:22.267 --> 01:13:23.268
This way.

1000
01:14:46.351 --> 01:14:48.222
Oh, shit.

1001
01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:12.856
Go.

1002
01:15:16.076 --> 01:15:17.251
Psst.

1003
01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:26.783
Hey, everybody okay?

1004
01:15:26.826 --> 01:15:28.001
- Yes.
- Yes.

1005
01:15:28.045 --> 01:15:29.873
- What's happening?
- All right. Okay.

1006
01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:33.006
We're gonna get everybody
freed up and ready to move.

1007
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.094
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1008
01:15:35.226 --> 01:15:37.358
Hey, I'm gonna
have a look around.

1009
01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:39.273
Okay.

1010
01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:41.972
Now, we're gonna load back up
on that bus.

1011
01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:44.452
- Where are we going?
- Back to the plane.

1012
01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:45.932
What?

1013
01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:47.936
It's all right. I've made
contact with trailblazer.

1014
01:15:47.978 --> 01:15:50.850
I'm not sure what got through,
but they know we're alive.

1015
01:15:50.894 --> 01:15:54.506
So, they find that plane,
and they find us. All right?

1016
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.160
- Everybody ready to move?
- Yes.

1017
01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:58.815
All right. Shh. Quiet. Fast.

1018
01:16:06.387 --> 01:16:08.651
Okay. Quick, quick, quick.

1019
01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:10.609
Quick. Hurry.

1020
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.265
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go.

1021
01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:25.406
Can you drive this thing?

1022
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:27.278
Yeah. I can drive anything.

1023
01:16:29.062 --> 01:16:31.543
Okay. Here are the keys.
I think it's the big one.

1024
01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:34.894
- Stop.
- What?

1025
01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:36.243
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1026
01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:38.332
There's a bunch
of armed fuckers on the road.

1027
01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:41.292
We're gonna get mowed down
if we try to drive past them.

1028
01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:43.947
I can engage 'em, but it's
just gonna draw more of 'em.

1029
01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:47.472
Shit.

1030
01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:01.573
Okay, I can handle these guys.

1031
01:17:02.705 --> 01:17:03.836
How are you gonna do that?

1032
01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:08.711
I'm gonna distract them.
I'm gonna give myself up.

1033
01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.933
- That's your plan?
- Oh, you have a better one?

1034
01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:18.895
Look, we don't have
any other choice.

1035
01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:21.245
You're never gonna see
your goddamn family again.

1036
01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:23.900
What about their families?

1037
01:17:25.205 --> 01:17:27.512
Look, you know
I have to try, right?

1038
01:17:28.252 --> 01:17:29.949
I mean, I'm the captain.

1039
01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:32.433
These assholes are never gonna
kill me. Worth too much to them.

1040
01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:35.607
Yeah.

1041
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.653
Wait here. Take this.

1042
01:17:54.278 --> 01:17:56.367
Hello? Anyone?

1043
01:18:01.415 --> 01:18:02.982
I need to speak to junmar.

1044
01:18:05.637 --> 01:18:07.160
And I'm unarmed!

1045
01:18:07.204 --> 01:18:09.510
No, I'm the captain.
I'm the pilot here.

1046
01:18:19.216 --> 01:18:22.001
You're a pilot?
Captain torrance?

1047
01:18:25.091 --> 01:18:26.658
I need to speak to junmar.

1048
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:29.705
Datu junmar.

1049
01:18:49.507 --> 01:18:52.771
Other pilot say you leave
passengers to call for help.

1050
01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:55.339
How that go for you?

1051
01:18:59.256 --> 01:19:01.214
I came to talk to you
about that.

1052
01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:03.869
I contacted Manila.

1053
01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:05.958
They send, uh,

1054
01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:09.440
search and rescue for us,
lots of soldiers.

1055
01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:12.573
So, I'll be having
my passengers back, thank you.

1056
01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:21.209
You think you come here,

1057
01:19:21.234 --> 01:19:23.933
speak to me,
tell me do what you say.

1058
01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:27.414
You think backwards.

1059
01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:32.768
You in jolo now, pilot torrance.

1060
01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:35.945
No rescue coming.

1061
01:19:38.164 --> 01:19:40.819
Look, we had problems
in the air.

1062
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:42.821
I had to land the plane.

1063
01:19:44.649 --> 01:19:46.433
My people just want to go home.

1064
01:19:46.477 --> 01:19:48.392
- You can understand.
- They're my people now.

1065
01:19:49.567 --> 01:19:50.568
You're mine.

1066
01:19:51.308 --> 01:19:52.396
No matter why.

1067
01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.660
Everything in jolo belong to me.

1068
01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:57.749
Until I don't want.

1069
01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:06.802
No one care when small man die.

1070
01:20:07.715 --> 01:20:09.543
But I make example of big man?

1071
01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:11.850
I kill him?

1072
01:20:14.331 --> 01:20:16.507
Now they care. Now they pay.

1073
01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:21.991
Fuck you.

1074
01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:25.777
Hajan.

1075
01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.000
They're friendlies, captain. Stay
where you are. Stay where you are.

1076
01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:49.540
You hurt?

1077
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:52.499
Captain torrance, are you hurt?

1078
01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:54.066
No, I'm okay.

1079
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:55.522
We got the package intact.

1080
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:58.549
Eastern row, main house.
How copy? Shellback, out.

1081
01:20:58.592 --> 01:21:00.396
- Lake, you got the package.
- No, wait. Take the others.

1082
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.031
Hey, we got them. Let's move!

1083
01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:06.513
Move!

1084
01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:10.996
Move! Move in!

1085
01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:16.610
Got you. Move.

1086
01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:21.093
- Everybody okay?
- Everybody, get down!

1087
01:21:21.137 --> 01:21:22.660
Roll out! Roll out now!

1088
01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:31.451
Hajan!

1089
01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:36.108
Hajan.

1090
01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:53.734
Took a hell of a beating,
captain. How are you feeling?

1091
01:21:53.778 --> 01:21:55.084
Okay. Okay, thanks.

1092
01:21:56.128 --> 01:21:57.738
Who are you guys?

1093
01:21:57.782 --> 01:21:59.194
We're trailblazer's
forward advance crew on this.

1094
01:21:59.218 --> 01:22:00.916
John Isaac.
Mo, Willis, and lake.

1095
01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:04.093
So, hold on.

1096
01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:05.268
You're the advance crew.

1097
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.097
When is the rescue team
getting here?

1098
01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:11.622
Twenty-four hours
is the best trailblazer can do,

1099
01:22:11.665 --> 01:22:14.190
so, unfortunately,
we just became the rescue team.

1100
01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:15.365
Twenty-four hours.

1101
01:22:16.888 --> 01:22:18.542
We won't be left by then.

1102
01:22:18.585 --> 01:22:21.458
I understand, and that's why
we need to work up a contingency.

1103
01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:23.808
Now, we did bring
an emergency fund,

1104
01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:26.506
but not enough to buy our way
off this island. So...

1105
01:22:28.247 --> 01:22:29.770
What do you suggest
we do, captain?

1106
01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:36.647
Fuck.

1107
01:22:37.909 --> 01:22:40.085
I got a plan.

1108
01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:43.567
No, that's not the assumption.

1109
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:45.525
We have very little information
at present.

1110
01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:47.179
However, we are coordinating

1111
01:22:47.223 --> 01:22:49.312
with all the search and
rescue efforts in the region.

1112
01:22:49.355 --> 01:22:50.515
Hopefully...

1113
01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:08.374
Dad.

1114
01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:12.813
I don't know
if you'll get this, but...

1115
01:23:15.903 --> 01:23:16.992
I love you so much.

1116
01:23:19.516 --> 01:23:21.561
You are the most amazing father.

1117
01:23:22.867 --> 01:23:25.174
And I'm sorry
if I don't say it enough.

1118
01:23:26.697 --> 01:23:27.897
I don't know what's happening.

1119
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.962
Or if you're hurt.

1120
01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:34.444
I'm so scared.

1121
01:23:36.663 --> 01:23:38.013
So, just please come home.

1122
01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.026
Trailblazer cp,
this is shellback 6.

1123
01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:53.811
Let's wait a sec.
Copy, 6. What's your status?

1124
01:23:53.854 --> 01:23:56.422
Hostages secure,
but we've got another plan.

1125
01:23:56.466 --> 01:23:57.728
You're not gonna like it.

1126
01:23:57.771 --> 01:23:58.879
Come on. Everybody, hurry.

1127
01:23:58.903 --> 01:24:00.165
Run, run, run!

1128
01:24:00.209 --> 01:24:01.558
Hey, gather them here.

1129
01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:03.362
- Everyone, come on.
- Gather around.

1130
01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:05.214
Come on!

1131
01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:07.564
Now, there is
no full rescue team

1132
01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:11.481
coming anytime soon,
not for the next 24 hours.

1133
01:24:11.524 --> 01:24:13.091
- What?
- We can't wait.

1134
01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:16.051
They are gonna come at us
with everything they've got,

1135
01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:17.922
and we're not gonna survive.

1136
01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:21.621
Now, dele and I managed to get
the power back up on the plane.

1137
01:24:21.665 --> 01:24:22.903
From the west end.

1138
01:24:22.927 --> 01:24:25.103
We only have one chance.

1139
01:24:25.147 --> 01:24:27.627
And that is me flying us
out of here in this thing.

1140
01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:28.822
- Wait, wait, wait. What?
- No way in hell.

1141
01:24:28.846 --> 01:24:30.978
- I know.
- Listen, listen.

1142
01:24:31.022 --> 01:24:33.285
Listen, listen, listen!

1143
01:24:33.329 --> 01:24:34.982
If I didn't believe
it could be done,

1144
01:24:35.026 --> 01:24:37.420
I would not put you guys
back on that plane.

1145
01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:40.814
I have a daughter.

1146
01:24:40.858 --> 01:24:43.339
I have every intention
of hugging her again

1147
01:24:43.382 --> 01:24:44.905
and making it home.

1148
01:24:44.949 --> 01:24:48.083
And I'm telling you that the
way home is on this plane.

1149
01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:50.563
I've got you this far.

1150
01:24:50.607 --> 01:24:53.566
I just need you to trust me
this one more bit. Okay?

1151
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:55.283
- All right, preflight checks.
- Copy that.

1152
01:24:55.307 --> 01:24:56.893
- Everybody, follow Mr. Dele.
- Follow me, come on.

1153
01:24:56.917 --> 01:24:58.789
- Okay. All right.
- Come on!

1154
01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:02.836
Come on!

1155
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.360
Shellback, how long have I got?

1156
01:25:04.403 --> 01:25:05.535
Two minutes tops.

1157
01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:07.276
Can't be certain
the damage already done

1158
01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:08.886
won't affect
flight characteristics

1159
01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:10.279
or that the engines won't fail.

1160
01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:11.604
Shellback said
it can be done.

1161
01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:12.759
He's the man on the ground.

1162
01:25:12.803 --> 01:25:14.109
Short of proper inspection,

1163
01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:15.260
he's not qualified
to make that determination.

1164
01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:16.850
They're being hunted, Terry.

1165
01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:18.417
And you're talking
about inspections?

1166
01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:19.853
After all they've been through,

1167
01:25:19.897 --> 01:25:21.681
imagine the fallout
if I allow torrance

1168
01:25:21.725 --> 01:25:24.031
to fly that plane
and incinerate everybody in it.

1169
01:25:24.075 --> 01:25:25.685
Imagine the fallout
if you don't.

1170
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:27.098
Make sure they get on okay.
Come on.

1171
01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:28.862
Run, run, run!

1172
01:25:33.693 --> 01:25:34.781
Everybody on.

1173
01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:39.856
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go, Maria.

1174
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.531
Ah, fuck.

1175
01:25:46.967 --> 01:25:48.380
We're about to have a lot
of bad guys up our asses.

1176
01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:49.903
I'm gonna need you
to pick up the pace, cap.

1177
01:25:49.927 --> 01:25:51.209
- All right.
- We've got two convoys

1178
01:25:51.233 --> 01:25:52.408
here and here,

1179
01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:54.410
and it looks like a third
is not far behind.

1180
01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:55.778
All right. I gotta
fix this brake first.

1181
01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:57.978
- You gotta buy me some time.
- Got it.

1182
01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:05.628
Like she said,
let's go. Let's go.

1183
01:26:16.693 --> 01:26:17.955
- Move!
- Bonnie!

1184
01:26:17.998 --> 01:26:19.435
I got it, captain! Help!

1185
01:26:20.523 --> 01:26:21.654
Keep moving.

1186
01:26:28.095 --> 01:26:29.488
Move! I can't get him.

1187
01:26:30.837 --> 01:26:31.882
Move, move, move!

1188
01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:35.102
Time to go, captain!
Time to go now!

1189
01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:01.172
Reloading!

1190
01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:13.793
Moving!

1191
01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.226
Shellback! Shellback,
I need comms.

1192
01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:57.681
It's already
on the team channel.

1193
01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:01.232
Once I start the engines,
you have two minutes.

1194
01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.321
- I'll leave the stairs down.
- Roger that.

1195
01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:07.107
You know I can't get
on that plane with you.

1196
01:28:07.151 --> 01:28:10.807
- Right?
- Yeah, okay. Good luck.

1197
01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.853
You too, my capitan.

1198
01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:49.236
Find a way
to strap him in, Bonnie.

1199
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.934
Everybody, stay down, okay?

1200
01:28:50.977 --> 01:28:52.979
Just hang with me
just a little bit longer.

1201
01:28:53.023 --> 01:28:55.025
The cabin doors won't seal
without a reset.

1202
01:28:55.068 --> 01:28:57.810
Keep them open, all of them,
okay? So they're balanced.

1203
01:28:59.638 --> 01:29:02.685
Avionics still shot.
Nothing on screens.

1204
01:29:02.728 --> 01:29:04.948
Checked the hydraulics.
They look good.

1205
01:29:04.991 --> 01:29:06.384
Okay. Apu working?

1206
01:29:06.428 --> 01:29:08.081
- Apu working.
- Engaged?

1207
01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.909
- Engaged.
- Okay.

1208
01:29:09.953 --> 01:29:10.954
All right, dele.

1209
01:29:12.999 --> 01:29:14.261
Start 'em up.

1210
01:29:14.305 --> 01:29:16.002
Starting engines.

1211
01:29:19.266 --> 01:29:21.834
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1212
01:29:21.878 --> 01:29:23.183
Get down!

1213
01:29:32.584 --> 01:29:34.412
Shit. I'm out of ammo.

1214
01:29:34.456 --> 01:29:36.458
Check our pallet.
Lake, reloading!

1215
01:29:51.255 --> 01:29:52.343
Reloading!

1216
01:30:09.012 --> 01:30:10.143
Shit.

1217
01:30:16.498 --> 01:30:17.692
I need you
with me, dele.

1218
01:30:17.716 --> 01:30:19.116
Keep your focus in here.

1219
01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:20.763
Hey, into the live.

1220
01:30:21.807 --> 01:30:23.026
Let's turn this baby around.

1221
01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.998
They hit our fuel tanks,
we're toast.

1222
01:30:49.879 --> 01:30:51.141
This is captain torrance.

1223
01:30:51.184 --> 01:30:53.360
Is anyone there?

1224
01:30:53.404 --> 01:30:55.754
Is anyone there, god damn it?
I'm about to take off.

1225
01:30:55.798 --> 01:30:58.496
Captain, you listen to me. That
plane stays right where she is.

1226
01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.952
- Am I understood?
- Captain torrance,

1227
01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:02.369
my name is David scarsdale.
Tell me what you need.

1228
01:31:02.413 --> 01:31:04.241
I need directional assistance.

1229
01:31:04.284 --> 01:31:07.157
We have no radar, no nav.
We are fully manual.

1230
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.725
I figure we've got
about 300 miles tops.

1231
01:31:09.768 --> 01:31:11.291
Find me a place to land.

1232
01:31:13.685 --> 01:31:15.034
Shellback.

1233
01:31:15.078 --> 01:31:17.210
I need you and your men
on the plane now.

1234
01:31:17.254 --> 01:31:19.517
I'm gonna go as soon
as we make this turn.

1235
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:20.910
- Get to the plane!
- Check.

1236
01:31:22.128 --> 01:31:23.129
Cover me!

1237
01:31:29.222 --> 01:31:30.572
Let's go!

1238
01:31:39.624 --> 01:31:41.234
Do we have enough road?

1239
01:31:41.278 --> 01:31:42.322
It's gonna have to be.

1240
01:31:43.106 --> 01:31:44.760
Gaspare, move! Move!

1241
01:31:47.763 --> 01:31:48.807
Gaspare, move!

1242
01:31:53.595 --> 01:31:54.726
Gaspare!

1243
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:55.814
Come on!

1244
01:32:01.646 --> 01:32:02.865
Let's go!

1245
01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:05.258
My wing clear.

1246
01:32:05.302 --> 01:32:06.862
My wing is clear.

1247
01:32:10.742 --> 01:32:12.178
Can't wait
any longer, shellback.

1248
01:32:12.222 --> 01:32:13.223
What's your status?

1249
01:32:14.746 --> 01:32:16.443
Go on.
Take us up, captain.

1250
01:32:31.284 --> 01:32:32.547
Get down!

1251
01:32:51.914 --> 01:32:53.089
What the fuck?

1252
01:33:25.469 --> 01:33:26.470
Full throttle.

1253
01:34:08.381 --> 01:34:10.296
Cap, your shoulder.

1254
01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.820
I'm okay.

1255
01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:17.782
We're losing power,
right engine.

1256
01:34:17.826 --> 01:34:19.218
- Shutting it down.
- No!

1257
01:34:19.262 --> 01:34:21.699
We need all the thrust
we can get.

1258
01:34:21.743 --> 01:34:24.876
- We're gonna hit. We're gonna hit.
- Save left engine.

1259
01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:28.750
Come on.

1260
01:34:37.889 --> 01:34:40.413
Lost right engine.
Shut it down now.

1261
01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:41.545
Shutting down two.

1262
01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:50.162
How bad?

1263
01:34:50.206 --> 01:34:52.382
Right wing's trailing edge
is damaged.

1264
01:34:52.425 --> 01:34:54.689
Shit. Okay,
just keep an eye on it.

1265
01:34:55.777 --> 01:34:57.343
This is trailblazer 119.

1266
01:34:58.431 --> 01:34:59.911
We're airborne.

1267
01:34:59.955 --> 01:35:01.106
Trailblazer 119,

1268
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:03.654
reading your air speed
at 135 knots.

1269
01:35:04.394 --> 01:35:05.612
Bordering stall rate.

1270
01:35:05.656 --> 01:35:07.310
This is as fast as she'll go.

1271
01:35:07.353 --> 01:35:09.331
Reading
your altitude at 400 feet.

1272
01:35:09.355 --> 01:35:12.097
You need to take her up to 3,000
or she's not staying up.

1273
01:35:12.141 --> 01:35:14.230
Negative on speed
and altitude.

1274
01:35:14.273 --> 01:35:16.536
119, you need
to take her up now.

1275
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.582
We have no fucking doors.

1276
01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:21.106
We're depressurized,
we're low on fuel

1277
01:35:21.150 --> 01:35:23.892
and we just lost an engine. Now,
don't tell me what I already know.

1278
01:35:23.935 --> 01:35:25.415
Find me a place to land.

1279
01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.875
Pulling up lists
of available airfields now.

1280
01:35:30.899 --> 01:35:32.683
Let's get it up on the screen.

1281
01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:34.598
Best option, siasi island,

1282
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:36.426
50 miles due south.

1283
01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:39.298
Adjust your heading to 15
degrees. There's a small airport there.

1284
01:35:39.342 --> 01:35:40.735
Can you make it?

1285
01:35:40.778 --> 01:35:42.606
We're gonna find out.

1286
01:35:43.694 --> 01:35:45.914
Jungle cleared. Feet wet.

1287
01:35:49.656 --> 01:35:51.658
Have a visual on siasi.

1288
01:35:51.702 --> 01:35:54.096
Come on. Come on, baby.
Just a little bit more.

1289
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:56.620
Lost right-side control.

1290
01:36:01.712 --> 01:36:02.713
Losing altitude.

1291
01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:11.374
Have a visual on siasi runway.

1292
01:36:13.419 --> 01:36:15.465
Prepare for landing!

1293
01:36:15.508 --> 01:36:17.423
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!

1294
01:36:30.436 --> 01:36:31.611
Full reverse on one.

1295
01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:33.962
Speed brakes.

1296
01:36:37.356 --> 01:36:38.749
Help me on the brakes, dele.

1297
01:36:52.937 --> 01:36:54.025
Oh.

1298
01:37:03.295 --> 01:37:04.731
Are we okay?

1299
01:37:04.775 --> 01:37:05.907
Yes.

1300
01:37:17.919 --> 01:37:19.094
Good job.

1301
01:37:19.137 --> 01:37:21.357
Congratulations, everyone.
Thank you.

1302
01:37:25.535 --> 01:37:26.753
You okay?

1303
01:37:29.931 --> 01:37:31.019
I've had better days.

1304
01:37:33.935 --> 01:37:35.055
One minute at a time, right?

1305
01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:37.634
One minute at a time.

1306
01:38:10.406 --> 01:38:11.842
You're a hell
of a pilot, captain.

1307
01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:13.766
- Mission accomplished?
- Absolutely.

1308
01:38:14.192 --> 01:38:15.324
You need to see someone?

1309
01:38:15.367 --> 01:38:16.847
Let's keep moving, everybody.

1310
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:18.085
- You're the captain!
- Come on, man.

1311
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:19.549
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1312
01:38:33.646 --> 01:38:34.734
Captain, you okay?

1313
01:38:35.779 --> 01:38:37.650
- Yeah, I am.
- Are you okay, captain?

1314
01:38:37.694 --> 01:38:40.088
Oh, yeah.
No, it looks worse than it is.

1315
01:38:40.131 --> 01:38:41.959
I think it was just a ricochet
or something.

1316
01:38:42.003 --> 01:38:43.091
Oh.

1317
01:38:45.006 --> 01:38:47.660
Hopefully, this is a better
layover than the last one.

1318
01:38:53.884 --> 01:38:55.059
All right, guys.

1319
01:38:56.321 --> 01:38:58.019
- It's been an honor.
- Yeah.

1320
01:38:58.845 --> 01:38:59.934
Good job, dele.

1321
01:39:01.152 --> 01:39:02.284
Just give me a moment.

1322
01:39:10.379 --> 01:39:11.467
Hey.

1323
01:39:12.903 --> 01:39:14.011
Are you gonna
go to the hospital?

1324
01:39:14.035 --> 01:39:15.166
I will.

1325
01:39:16.559 --> 01:39:17.647
Okay.

1326
01:39:18.604 --> 01:39:19.736
Hey.

1327
01:39:26.003 --> 01:39:27.091
Thank you so much.

1328
01:39:28.919 --> 01:39:30.007
Thank you.

1329
01:41:09.454 --> 01:41:10.542
Hey, it's me.

1330
01:41:11.761 --> 01:41:12.849
I'm coming home.

1331
01:41:14.677 --> 01:41:15.765
Yeah.

1332
01:41:17.723 --> 01:41:19.682
Yeah, you were right.
I'm gonna be a bit late.
